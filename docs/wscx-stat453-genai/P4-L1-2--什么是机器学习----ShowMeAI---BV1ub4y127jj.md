Yeahï¼Œ before we jump into deep learningï¼Œ let me briefly define what machine learning is and what it is all about in a few minutesã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_1.png)

So it all goes back to the traditional programming paradigm So what do I mean by that it's like yeah the development of computer software to make our lives easier So I think one of the motivations behind developing software was to make common tasks more convenient for example replacing physical mail while let's say email although it's not 10% replaced but yeah with that like change now things a little bit more convenient compared to writing a letter by hand and then bringing it to the post office and then taking a few days until it's delivered and so forth email makes this whole communication aspect more convenient although I would say maybe email is not so great because everyone included I think think that email is maybe not making life easier but harder because theres no more email than physical mailã€‚

In any caseï¼Œ so let's now imagine you have an email program and you want to make email more convenientã€‚

 You want to filter out spamã€‚ So unwanted emailã€‚ So imagine you want to design aã€‚Sm filterã€‚

So as a programmerã€‚You want to design the spam filtersã€‚ So our program is theã€‚Sm filterã€‚

 And then we can give this to the computer who then will produceuse the outputsï¼Œ which would beã€‚

The labelã€‚Whether something isã€‚Sm onã€‚Not spam or maybe going one stepã€‚Furtherã€‚

 just putting it into the right folderï¼Œ like either the inbox or the spam box on our email programã€‚

Nowï¼Œ how do we design this filterï¼Œ I meanï¼Œ as a programmer this could be a very tedious exerciseã€‚

 we would first take a look at examples of email so we would take a look at our inbox and then look at what could be some spam email we would then compared to non spam emailã€‚

 think about it and maybe come up with a rule that says for exampleï¼Œ if let's say ifã€‚å‘ƒï¼Œemailã€‚

Hat the wordã€‚å—¯ã€‚Let's sayã€‚Wenã€‚ðŸ˜”ï¼ŒMoney or something like thatã€‚In the subjectã€‚äººã€‚Classified as spamã€‚

And then you can have an elseã€‚If something else and so forthï¼Œ you can develop these rulesã€‚

 hard code them in your program and thenï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ develop a spam folder like thatã€‚

 But I think it would be super tedious to do that because you would have to take a look at a lot of messages and do a lot of testing and see if your rule works and ifã€‚

Some additional L else if statement could improve it and notã€‚

 And it is like a lot of work like to take a look at thisã€‚ And this is why machine learning is soã€‚

 yeahï¼Œ popular because it can make this life easier for us programmers for developing software that canã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ classify thingsã€‚So hereï¼Œ in contrast at the bottomã€‚

 I have machine learning in contrast to that traditional programming paradigmã€‚

 So in machine learningï¼Œ instead of yeahï¼Œ having the programmer look at theseã€‚

Inputs and making decisionsï¼Œ we provide the machine learning algorithm with inputs and outputsã€‚

 againï¼Œ outputs would be the labels for our emailã€‚ so we have a labeled data setã€‚

So here this would beã€‚Our emails and the outputs would be whether they areã€‚Sm or not spamã€‚

 So a human actually would have to label thoseã€‚ So you have to have a human to assign these labelsã€‚

To show the computer what we wantã€‚ So it's basically this is what what we wantã€‚

 the desire desirable outcomeã€‚ So we have as a human we have to of course communicate to the computer what we wantã€‚

 we have to say okayï¼Œ we want spam and non spam email labels So we provide these as examples and then the computer can learn rules to make this classification so the computers actually developing this program This is ourã€‚

Machineã€‚Learningã€‚ðŸ˜”ï¼ŒModelï¼Œ and then the machine learning model can actually replaceã€‚

Our role as the programmer developing the program manuallyã€‚

 we can actually give the program directly to the computer to produce new outputs on new dataã€‚

 So machine learning is theã€‚In a wayï¼Œ the automatic learning from examplesã€‚

 So there's also a famous quote by Arthur Samuelã€‚ This is a quote that you can find in almost every machine learning textbookã€‚

 So the quote goes like thisã€‚ Ma learning is the field of study that gives computers the eibility to learn without being explicitly programmed soã€‚

Here that means we are providing examples and then the algorithm learns automatically based on the data instead of having humans thinking about these routes that's machine learning in a nutshellã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_3.png)

Specificallyï¼Œ this is a subfield of machine learning called supervised learningã€‚

 which I will talk about in a future videoã€‚So yeahã€‚

 but you may wonder how is machine learning now related to deep learning andï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 artificial intelligenceï¼Œ you probably all heard about AI and artificial intelligenceã€‚

 most of the time nowadays deep learning in AI used interchangeablyï¼Œ howeverã€‚

 there is a distinction I wanted to brieflyã€‚Discuss So machine learningã€‚

 I would say is the biggest fieldã€‚ It's likeï¼Œ yeah the field encompassing deep learningã€‚

 So deep learning is strictly a subfield of machine learningã€‚ A subfield that focuses on yeahã€‚

 neural networksï¼Œ deep neural networks and AI is intersecting with bothã€‚

 I would say if there's one thing about this graphic is I made theã€‚This one maybeã€‚Notï¼Œ that meanã€‚

 not big enoughï¼Œ but maybe I made thisï¼Œ this part here too bigã€‚

 So there is also what I wanted to say here is there are also AI methods that don't use machine learningã€‚

 So let me go through these things step by stepã€‚

![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_5.png)

So first of allï¼Œ there are different types of AIï¼Œ so usually we say generally AI is artificial intelligenceã€‚

 which is a subfield of computer science solving tasks humans are good atï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 natural languageï¼Œ speech recognitionï¼Œ image recognition and so forthï¼Œ and then we can subcategoizeã€‚

AI into twoï¼Œ yeah smaller categoriesï¼Œ one is narrow AIã€‚And one is artificial general intelligenceã€‚

So what is narrow AI N AI is a form of AI that is focused on solving a particular taskã€‚

 so only one task at a timeï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ image classification or playing a game driving a car let's say an algorithm for unlocking your phone So this would be a narrow AI because it can only do one task so it's not like a humanã€‚

 a human can do multiple thingsï¼Œ I mean I can yeah go skiingï¼Œ I can do cooking I canã€‚

Bite emails I can yeah record a lecture and things like thatï¼Œ so I can do multiple thingsã€‚

 but a narrow AI system can only do one thing that it has been developed forã€‚ In contrastã€‚

 artificial general intelligence is multipurpose AI mimic mimicking a human intelligence across multiple tasksã€‚

So if you have seen the movie X Makinnaï¼Œ the robot in this movieï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 I would say would be more like an AGI agent where it can do things a human can doã€‚

 So multiple things not only classifying images for exampleã€‚

 So that way there's a difference between narrow AI and AGIã€‚

 However AGI is for most people what they want to accomplishã€‚ It is like the far future goalã€‚

 but we are not very close to that one yet so that's like people are actually arguing whether it's possible at allã€‚

 whether it will be possible some people think it's like within 50 yearsã€‚

 some people say within 1000 yearsã€‚There's actually a nice bookã€‚ What was the nameã€‚

 Architects of Intelligenceï¼Œ where the authorï¼Œ I think his last name was Fortã€‚

 I forgot the first nameã€‚ So the author interviewedã€‚

Multiple experts in deep learning when they would predict AGI will be inventedã€‚

 And there's like a hugeï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ huge span of predictions betweenï¼Œ I don't knowï¼Œ20 andã€‚

20 years and maybe 10000 years or maybe never things like thatã€‚

 So no one really has a good idea even when or if this will ever be inventedã€‚

 Na AI is something that we have nowadays inï¼Œ in almost every aspect of our livesã€‚

 And I will also talk more about examples of thatã€‚

![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_7.png)

So yeah so why did I why did I draw these circles like that So AI there was also something called good oldfashioned AI it does not always have to involve machine learning For exampleã€‚

 when we developed our spam filter a few slides back when I designed these F and else rules as a programmer I was developing an intelligent system right if I add enough of these F and else rulesã€‚

 This system will be intelligent and will be able to sort my emails by spam and not spam However for that I didn't use machine learningã€‚

 So in that way AI doesn't always have to use machine learningã€‚Nowadaysã€‚

 most of the II systems use machine learning thoughã€‚

 and also even more of them are using deep learning because deep learning is usually yeah very good at natural language and computer visionã€‚

So and this is also the focus of this courseã€‚ and this courseï¼Œ we will be focusing on deep learningã€‚

Regular machine learning that is not deep learning could beï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ generalized linear modelsã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ linear logistic regressionï¼Œ tree based methods and certainã€‚

 yeah methods like random forests orã€‚Grading boostingï¼Œ support vector machinesã€‚

 can nearest neighborsã€‚ This is allã€‚Something we covered inã€‚Machine learning statistics 4ã€‚

51 introduction to machine learning and the fall semesterã€‚ In this semesterã€‚

 we will be specifically focused on deep learningï¼Œ which is deep neural networksã€‚

 which are very good at our computer vision and natural languageã€‚

 which is something these methods are not good atã€‚ So these methodsã€‚

Only because we call them traditional doesn't mean they are badã€‚ They are still reallyã€‚

 really powerful and useful for tabular dataã€‚ I will explain what I mean by that laterã€‚

 So they are really good at learning from tabular data and deep learning is more suited for learning from raw data like images and speech and things like thatã€‚

 So it's it's not like one is better than the otherã€‚ The purposes are kind of differentã€‚

 So that's that's main difference basicallyã€‚

![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_9.png)

Yeahï¼Œ so yeah just one more example of an AI system that does not involve machine learning and deep learning so as far as I know I mean I was a little bit young back thenã€‚

 but as far as I know deep blue that was like a old chess computer is not based on machine learningã€‚

 it is like using an alpha beta search which is a search algorithm for finding good chess moves and as far as I know for example this would be an example of a good old-fashed artificial intelligence that is not involving machine learning I may be wrong but then there are definitely examples of AI systems that don't useã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_11.png)

Machine runningã€‚So then in general we can say I is yeah a system that employs rules and is kind of intelligent through these rules by using these rulesã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ if you think back of OS spam filterï¼Œ that we could develop by hand by having a lot of FNL statementsã€‚

 this can become intelligent as a narrow AIï¼Œ but it doesn't necessarily have to involve machine learningã€‚

And yeah machine learning is about algorithms that learn models or representations or rules automatically from data and examples to the label dataã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ if you think back of the slide that I showed you when we showed the algorithm examples of labeled email and then the algorithm would develop the program that would be what machine learning is about and then deep learning is also machine learning but it is specifically focused on multilayer neural networksã€‚

 so they are a little bit more more complex thanã€‚Simple algorithms but not necessarilyã€‚

 they have usually more parametersï¼Œ and we will see all about that in this courseã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_13.png)

Yeah here are some applications of machine learning and deep learning and practiceã€‚

 So when we already covered the email spam detection another popular example of machine learning would be or deep learning specific would be fingerprint and face detection and matching on the phone So if you have a smartphone you probably either have fingerprintã€‚

 sensor or camera that detects your face to unlock your phone or web search is also heavily using machine and deep learning for exampleã€‚

 Dr Go Bing in Google sports predictions people use it for making predictions at the post office also machine learning and deep learning are used for yeah scanning inã€‚

The letters the letters on the letters and the zip codes and then categorize yeah the letters by zip codes like image recognition and handwriting recognition and the same is true for ATMs for reading checks This was actually one of the earliest applications of deep learning or machine learningã€‚

 It was a multilayer neural network in particular a convolution in neural network which we will be covering in this course it was called Lnet and it is goes back to the 90s so it's almost 30 years ago that was one of the early applications of deep learning I meanã€‚

 I say deep learning back then the term deep learning wasn't inventedã€‚

 So back then people called it machine learning but it was deep neural networkã€‚So here's a fun videoã€‚

 It's a real old video from the 90sã€‚ Yeahï¼Œ illustrating how this worksã€‚ So here's a handwrittenã€‚

Image of yeah handwritten digitã€‚ and then the machine learning hereã€‚

 machine learning system here recognizes which digit that isï¼Œ and that can be then used in an ATMã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ or for sorting the zip codesã€‚Soï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 we will be developing much more sophisticated systems in these next couple of weeksã€‚ but this isã€‚

 I thinkï¼Œ a yeahï¼Œ niceï¼Œ nice example of classic deep learningã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_15.png)

Yeahï¼Œ other applications includeï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ smart assistance like Apple Siri like the voice assistant and also Amazon Alexexa and all these types of voice assistance nowadays or using deep learningã€‚

 and then yeah product recommendations if you no Netflix or Amazonã€‚

 they always recommend products based on yeah machine learning self-driving carsã€‚

 unfortunately still not here yetã€‚ I meanï¼Œ I'm it's unfortunateï¼Œ but yeahã€‚

 that would be another great applicationï¼Œ not applicationï¼Œ but at least example of deep learningã€‚

 It's actually a little bit complicatedã€‚ So there are many things at work from reinforcement learning to supervised learning with imagesã€‚

 So here's like a little example from Waymoã€‚ So that would be anotherã€‚

Area where where AI deep learning machine learning are used language translationï¼Œ sentiment analysisã€‚

 drug designï¼Œ medical diagnose and things like thatã€‚

 So I will also at the end of each week upload a video that I will call stuffã€‚

In the news where I will yeah highlight some of the recent applications or interesting things in the deep learning worldã€‚

 where I will show you way more examplesã€‚ for exampleã€‚

 I'm just thinking of this because when I mentioned medical diagnose is there was like a system recentlyã€‚

 a new system for detecting CoviId from lung Xraysï¼Œ left but lots of these systems latelyã€‚

 but there was a particularly good oneï¼Œ for example last weekã€‚In collaboration with doctors at NYuã€‚

 And I will show you more examples of deep learning in the real world in these stuff in the news videosã€‚

 But yeahï¼Œ that is just a quick overview of machine learningã€‚



![](img/7e606a918420d16e0a7372fd83752db3_17.png)

Just to lay the groundworkã€‚ And then in the next few videosã€‚

 I will say a little bit more about the subcategories of machine learningã€‚ It also appliesã€‚

 of courseï¼Œ to deep learning because we've learned that deep learning is a subcategory of machine learning And we will also talk more about the workflow and some jargonã€‚

 And then about the tools we'll be using this courseã€‚ So this is still all lecture 1ã€‚

 And then yeah I willã€‚Pasuse this video here and then record the next one on the broad categories of machine learningã€‚
