Yeah regarding the cost material and informationï¼Œ we will be using canvas in the semesterã€‚

 The reason is really that it makes things easier for me and for you because everything will be in one placeã€‚

 So yeah that I mean announcements and your grades and also yeah Piazza I will say a few more words about thatã€‚

 So yeah I think have everything in one place will make things easierã€‚ Yeahï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 we will also be using other technologies like Githubã€‚ Howeverã€‚

 I will then post links to that on canvasã€‚ So youd never have to really go out there and search for things by yourself in different placesã€‚

 everything will be here and the modules on canvasã€‚ Soã€‚

What I'm showing you here is a screenshot just of some things you have prior seenã€‚

 So here was some optional preco preparation materials that I shared during the winter break for those of you who may have not used Python beforeã€‚

 but have some programming language backgroundsã€‚ So yeah as a requirement for this classã€‚

 you should have taken a programme classã€‚ It doesn't have to be Pythonã€‚ Howeverã€‚

 we will be using Python in this courseã€‚ Of courseã€‚

 we don't have to be expert programmers in Python for this classã€‚

 we will only use very basic features in Pythonï¼Œ but it will be immensely helpful for youã€‚

If you learn a little bit about how Python works and yeah I shared some resources for you hereã€‚

 it shouldn't take that much effortã€‚ It's really only the basicsã€‚

 and I think it will make your life in this class easierã€‚

 Also we won't be using Python right away in the first few weeksã€‚

 I think we will be probably starting in week3 to use Pythonã€‚

 So in that way there's no stress to do it like todayã€‚

 but it would be good maybe in the next couple of days if you don't have any Python experience to yeah look over these resourcesã€‚

Then yeah also posted a lot of information about the syllabus a couple of days agoã€‚

 I don't want to really go over everything hereã€‚ I think it's maybe more efficient if you just read through what I've posted there it's really just the topics that I already discussed in a few minutes ago that we are going to cover a little bit about this course you probably already know that because otherwise you wouldn't have enrolled then yeah some basic comments on where the information for this course is located mainly on canvas some other resources like optional textbooks that may be helpful to you and also how we communicate in this course I will also say a little bit more about that in the next couple of slidesã€‚

Then yeah course logisticsï¼Œ some expectations like how I will deliver content and how you are expected to participateã€‚

 So content wise I will be uploading videos on Tuesdays and Thursdays why Tuesdays and Thursdays yeah that was usually what I have done and in person when there was the regular semester and also it's kind of easier for me because yeah when the week starts on Monday I will start recording the videos for Tuesday and then on Tuesday I will catch up withã€‚

Emails and workã€‚ And then on Wednesdayï¼Œ I will be recording the back lectures for Thursday and things like thatã€‚

 So it's also a good rhythm for meã€‚Yeahï¼Œ then there are some other resources and useful material that I posted hereã€‚

 some information about gradingï¼Œ I will also talk about this in a few slides and also about the class project and the exam and then also importantly the rulesã€‚

 rights and responsibilities that you have and should know and then also a little bit about the COVID context also just where you can find information about COVID and how it affects campus so here I'm just linking the campus guidelines you should also maybe take a look at that if you are not familiar with that yetã€‚



![](img/16f52147923da08c48cad27edab260cc_1.png)

All rightã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo regarding the weekly content like I mentionedã€‚

 I will be uploading videos on Tuesdays and Thursdays or let's say I will upload the Monday night and Wednesday night such that they are available on Tuesday mornings and Thursday morningsã€‚

 so that's yeah to the best of my ability that's my my plan here for this semesterã€‚ Soã€‚

A typical week may then look like thisã€‚ So here isï¼Œ it's not uploaded yet when I'm recording itã€‚

 but when you are seeing this videoï¼Œ it's probably already uploadedã€‚

 So what I'm showing you here is how a typical week would look likeã€‚

So here's a link to the office hoursã€‚ will have we will be having office hours via Zoomã€‚

 the T A and me so I will have my office hours on Tuesdays from 6 to 7 and the T A from 7 to 8 PMm I think so we both have office hours in the evening and that is because I think it's easier for people who are in different time zonesã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ some people I know are in China and then it would be I think 6 pm here would be 9 a in the morning there or 8 AMã€‚

 So I think it's like a more reasonable time because last semester we had office hours like more in the afternoon and then some people had to have the alarm clock at 3 am in the morning to join the office hours we always had to find additional time slots and I think having this office hours slot in the evening might be more convenient this timeã€‚

I think 6 PMm is also maybe reasonable for people who are in medicineã€‚

 so in that way it's like a good I think sweet spotã€‚ Allrightã€‚

 and then like I said I will be uploading content on Tuesdays and Thursdays so there will be a page a canvas page with all the videos embedded there and the same thing for Thursday and I will also post some additional material like extra reading material there or I will link it there so if you want to have some more information beyond let's say just the videos I will also try to post some interesting papers or additional reading material in these pages related to the lectureã€‚

And then at the end of the week I'm planning to make every week a self-assesment quizã€‚

 So this quiz will be three to five simple multiple choice questionsã€‚ It's just like yeahã€‚

 so to help you stay on trackï¼Œ there will be a few points for this quizã€‚ So of courseã€‚

 yeah you should do the quiz because it will be counting towards your final gradeã€‚

 it won't be like heavily weighted only a small number of points for these quizzesã€‚

 but it's I think helping you will help you to keep on track because you have to watchã€‚Theseï¼Œ yeahã€‚

 materials in order toã€‚Do the quizã€‚ I meanï¼Œ you can do it without watching the videosã€‚

 but then I think youï¼Œ you have to guessï¼Œ really because the questions will be related to the video contentã€‚

 Of courseï¼Œ the I will post the quiz at the end of the weekï¼Œ but it will not be due the same dayã€‚

 It will be due one week laterã€‚ So if youã€‚Let'd say don't have completed videos by the end of the weekã€‚

 You still can watch the one of video on the weekend or the beginning of the next weekã€‚

 So we'll have like 7ï¼Œ approximately 7 daysã€‚After the videos have been posted to complete the self assessment quizã€‚

 I think that's like alsoï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ I will think this will help you to keep on track and notï¼Œ let's sayã€‚

 delayã€‚Yeahï¼Œ going through the content too much and help you to stay on track in this classã€‚

 Allrightï¼Œ so the gradingï¼Œ I think that's probably some question or something you are curious aboutã€‚

 soã€‚

![](img/16f52147923da08c48cad27edab260cc_3.png)

![](img/16f52147923da08c48cad27edab260cc_4.png)

How I decided to do things this semester is that there will be 30% of the grade will be from problem setsã€‚

 that's homeworks and these self assessment quizzesã€‚So regarding the homeworksã€‚

 I don't know exactly how many homeworks there will beã€‚

 I will be making them every two weeks approximately and there will be a new homeworkã€‚

 These are a little bit longer than the quizzes and they won't be multiple choiceã€‚

 they will be involving usually some free form answer or some slight codingã€‚So in that wayã€‚

 there will be approximately five homeworks this semester a little bit moreï¼Œ maybeã€‚ So fiveã€‚

 I would say5 to 7ã€‚And there will be the self assessment  quiz every weekã€‚

And then this will be 30% of your gradeï¼Œ20% of your grade will be from the midterm examã€‚

I posted the dateï¼Œ I thinkï¼Œ in the syllabus for the midtermer examã€‚

 I will send another announcement about thatã€‚I just forgot the date right nowï¼Œ so I can'tã€‚

Recall it on top of my headï¼Œ but it was more like laterï¼Œ I thinkï¼Œ sometime in Marchï¼Œ I thinkã€‚

 so don't worry about it yetã€‚So 20% will be the midterm examã€‚

 which will be online on canvas so and then 50% will be the class projectã€‚

 So I think this is the most fun part on the class because this is something where you get to be creative so first you get to propose a class project topicã€‚

That has to be related to machine learning or deepï¼Œ I meanï¼Œ deep learningï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 So it will be related to deep learningã€‚ And you will be working in and teams with3ã€‚

Students in totalï¼Œ S three students perã€‚Team and we will wait a few days or let's say maybe a week or two until I ask you to find team members because there are students in the beginning who are still on the wait list and some students may change their classes so we will wait a few days or weeks until things have settled so then we will form student teams of consisting of three students each and then with your team you will be thinking or brainstorming deep learning related projectã€‚

 I will post data sets that you may consider our data resources and websites and also project ideas and I will also post some examples from previous semesters so that you can get an idea of what roughly is expectedã€‚

 I don't want to do this right now because there are so many things probably going on right nowã€‚

 but in the next couple of daysã€‚I will share more information about thatã€‚ So don't worry about itã€‚

 And it won't be due until I would say also like Marchã€‚ So in this proposalï¼Œ whatã€‚

 what is the goal of this proposalï¼Œ This is really a two page reportã€‚So againã€‚

 I will share more information laterï¼Œ but it will be a po to pageã€‚

Report where you let me know what you are interested in working onã€‚

 and then I can give you some feedback to let you know whether this is a good idea or not or maybe also to give you some more tips regarding your projects and supply you with resources or additional ideasã€‚

And soã€‚The grading isï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ it's only 5% of the total gradeã€‚ So in that wayï¼Œ it's more aboutã€‚Yeahã€‚

 I'm making sure that you have a good idea forã€‚The rest of the semester that you can work on itã€‚

And yeahï¼Œ and then at the end of the semesterï¼Œ there will be a project presentationã€‚

 It's a oral presentation and a project reportã€‚ So of courseï¼Œ the semester is virtualã€‚

 so it will be recordedã€‚ so you will be recording a video shortã€‚8 to 10ã€‚Minute presentationã€‚

 and that will be shared with other students in this classã€‚

 So we will be all watching the presentationsï¼Œ and there will also be a project report then also at the end of the semesterã€‚

 and the project reportï¼Œ this will be a 8ã€‚Page written report in the form of a it will look like a conference paperã€‚

 I will give you a template for thatã€‚And this is really where you would write up should be style conference paper styleã€‚

 This will be where you will be writing up your project more formally in the form of a paper and I really think this will give you some realwell experience with working on a deep learning project how you communicate it also in the presentation and then also how you write it up for exampleã€‚

 also later on if you're interested in academic path where you publish papers that might be a great exercise to if you have not done that already like work on papersã€‚

 but also in industryï¼Œ a lot of people in deep learning publishing papers nowadays so either way I think this is a very useful exercise for you and it's also great for your CV you can optionally share your project for exampleã€‚

 on Gitthub if you like and then if you imply for an internshipã€‚

 you can show that you have worked on a creative individual project I think it's always a good ideaã€‚

Okayï¼Œ but againï¼Œ like I saidï¼Œ I will share more about thatã€‚

 one little aspect I wanted to say is also there will be a peer review stage that is something I've not done in previous semesters and I thought it might be also a good idea that is something where each student will be reviewing three other students reports and project presentations andã€‚

Also give feedback basicallyã€‚ So in that wayï¼Œ I think that might be also a cool thing to doã€‚

 like providing feedback on other students presentations and reportsã€‚Alrightï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 I will also be providing feedback what this is like for you among each otherã€‚

 so I think that's also niceã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒYeahï¼Œ regarding the communication in this courseã€‚

 so how how are you going to ask questions and how are we having discussionsï¼ŸYeahï¼Œ first of allã€‚

 we will have the office hoursã€‚W Zoomï¼Œ so that will be a face to face live office hoursã€‚

And in addition to that we will be using canvas for the asynchronous communicationã€‚

 so Piazza is like an online forum which is in canvas so only the students in this class have access to it and you can post questions either showing like your name to the other students or also anonymously if you prefer so the name if you post there it will be only visible let's say to me if you post anonymously but you are of course encouraged to also post yeah just generally with showing your name so if you want to find for example team members and things like that you can also use Piazza and this is really like for questions about this course about the lecture contents andã€‚

Yeahï¼Œ everything related to this courseï¼Œ reallyã€‚ And what's nice about it isï¼Œ I thinkã€‚

Is that everything will be in one place And on Piazzaã€‚

 I can also see which questions I have answered and which I have not not answeredã€‚

 And I really prefer this over email becauseï¼Œ you knowã€‚

 a lot of people are sending me emails who are not in this class like our colleagues andã€‚

Paper reviews and everythingã€‚ And sometimes it'sï¼Œ yeah more difficult to catch up with email every dayã€‚

 So if you have a questionï¼Œ it's easier for me just to go to Piazza and see all the questions related to this class and I canã€‚

 I think answer them more quickly and there's also less danger that I miss a question compared to emails where email is always like always too much email and it's always easy to overlook somethingã€‚

 So on Piazza that will be more organizedã€‚ So you can also yeah send me private questions on Piazzaã€‚

 there's an option that only I will be able to see the questionã€‚

 So if you have some private question like I don't knowã€‚

 maybe you have a doctor's appointment and some issues came up and you can't complete homework for some reason that would be also a private option where you can ask meã€‚

Private question on Piazzaã€‚So there's also a goodã€‚Place to ask private questionsã€‚

 So where you don't have to worry that other people see thatã€‚ Anywayã€‚ So yeahã€‚

 we will be using then Piazza and Zoom for the communication in this classã€‚

 I hope this will work wellã€‚ We can adopt ifï¼Œ we need additional resourcesã€‚ Soï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 for the office hoursï¼Œ we will be having these links But if there's a reason you never can attend these office hours because you have another class during these timesã€‚

 We can also find optional additional datesã€‚Yeahï¼Œ importantã€‚

 one last important thing is I would really hardly strongly recommend that you enable the notifications on canvasã€‚

 I know it can be maybe a little bit annoyingï¼Œ but this way you get a notification via email if there's some new content because yeahã€‚

This way you don't have to always refresh the pageã€‚ if there's some new contentã€‚

 you will get an automatic automatic automatic messageã€‚ for exampleã€‚

 if there's a new deadline or new content uploaded and things like thatã€‚

 So I recommend activating these notificationsã€‚ So how you do that as you go to this little symbol here and then you go to notificationsã€‚

 and then there should be these preferences where you can just check theseã€‚ Allrightï¼Œ soã€‚

That is all I wanted to say about the courseã€‚ If you have questionsï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ we willã€‚

Have office hours this week so you can ask me that in person face to face or you can just post a question on Piazzaã€‚

 Honestlyï¼Œ what I also like really about Piazza is if you have a general question and you post it there then other students will see it as well and maybe other students had the same questionã€‚

 So this information will also be shared with other students which can be really useful So more efficient basic So instead of having every student asking me the question I that could be just one student asking the question and answeringã€‚

 I can answer it for everyone basically Alrightï¼Œ so then let me finish this video and then in the next video I will talkã€‚

Finallyï¼Œ more about machine learningã€‚
