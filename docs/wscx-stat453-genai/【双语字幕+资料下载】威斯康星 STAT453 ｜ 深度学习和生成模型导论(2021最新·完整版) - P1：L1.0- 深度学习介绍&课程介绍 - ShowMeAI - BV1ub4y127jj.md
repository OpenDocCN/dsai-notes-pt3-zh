Yeah， hi， everyone。 I hope you had a nice， long winter break and did something fun。 And yeah。

 ready for the new semester。 My name is Sebastian Rashka。

 and I'm an assistant professor of statistics， working mainly on machine learning and deep learning。

 So I'm particularly yeah interested and excited about this class。 it's about deep learning。

 as you may know。 So and that's very I have closely related to my research。

 So in this brief yeah video here， I just wanted to introduce myself。 And yeah。

 what we are going to talk about today。😊，So maybe just as a quick ice breaker。

 So I actually literally spent some a lot of time for the winter break on the ice。

 Yeah doing some cross country skiing and enjoying。Wisconsin and the landscape here。

 I really like yeah Wisconsins snow and stuff like that。

 So if you ever need a break from studying and want to go outside there are lots of beautiful parks here。

 state parks and also mostly it's not very crowded there so it's actually a great time now to hang out outside to do some exercises and have some fun next to studying but yeah back back to the lecture here or class So today I will mainly cover a few topics related to how the class is organized I will give you a brief overview of what to expect in this course。

 what topics we are going to cover how we are going to talk to each other because yeah it's all virtual and asynchronous。

 However， we will have live office via zoom so there will be some live component and we will also have everything organized on canvas where everything is easy to find there will be an online forum to ask questions also asynchronously if you like or prefer but again。

We will also have live office hours for questions and things like that。 Yeah。

 I will actually turn off the camera very soon when I talk about the remainder of these topics listed here because。

I'm using an iPad for this class， and it lies flat on my desk。

 So it won't be very interesting to watch me taking notes on my iPad because the camera would be just pointed to what's the top of my head。

 So I will be switching to the iPad views soon。Nonetheless。

 I think yeah using an iPad and the notation feature actually quite useful to illustrate some concepts better than just using the slides。

 So after giving you the course overview here， I will also then later introduce machine learning。

 a machine learning is not a requirement for this class。

 some of you I've already seen based on the class list have taken statistics 451。

 which I taught last semester。 This was the introduction to machine learning and statistical pattern classification。

 So in this class， we talked more about traditional methods for machine learning。

 and I was very careful when I designed these two courses that there is no overlap。

 So the other class is focused on traditional machine learning。about decision trees， random forests。

 other ensemble methods， gradient boosting and so forth in this class though。

 we will be entirely focused on deep learning and deep neural networks so there will not be any requirement from the last class for this class so everything right now will be relatively new except of course some overlaps that are concerned with supervised learning basically that we are interested in classifying things so that will be the only overlap but I don't think there will be a disadvantage if you take this class without having taken 451 but yeah long story short I will give you a brief overview of what machine learning is in this class and then also just outlining how supervised machine learning workflow looks like some。

Of the necessary jargon and notation。 and then also a little bit about the practical aspects of this course。

 because there will also be a class project and we will be using Pytorch and doing also some coding in this class。

 So in this way， there will be conceptual and practical aspects。

 And I hope that is a good mix yet to prepare you for machine learning projects and deep learning projects and of course。

 also deep learning in both academia and industry。 So that way let me then switch over to my iPad and get started with the course overview。
