# P48ÔºöL7.0- GPU ËµÑÊ∫êÂíå Google Colab - ShowMeAI - BV1ub4y127jj

YeahÔºå hi everyone„ÄÇ So in this video I want to show you some computational resources that you might find helpful for your later homeworks„ÄÇ

 but also for your class project where you can use a GPU for free to accelerate yeah the training of certain new networks„ÄÇ

 So with that let me minimize this screen and then show you hands on how we were to do that„ÄÇ

Yeah have to start withÔºå I found this very nice S up repository called Deep learning in the cloud„ÄÇ

 I will share the link with you„ÄÇ And here the contributors and maintainers put together a really nice list of all the different tools that are available for training deep neural networks in the cloud„ÄÇ

 So most of them alsoÔºå yeah supported GPus because it's the whole point„ÄÇ

 So it's like for clouded GPUus„ÄÇüòäÔºåAnd yeahÔºå not all of them are free„ÄÇNot here the most popular ones„ÄÇ

 as far as I know most people when they use free clouded GPUus„ÄÇ

 they use either Google Collaboratory or Kegel kernelnels„ÄÇ Both of them are free„ÄÇ

 There are some limitsÔºå thoughÔºå in terms of the runtime„ÄÇ I think you can only use one GPU„ÄÇ

 and it resets after 12 hoursÔºå but it's so nice to have an option here to use free services„ÄÇ

 especially as a student„ÄÇWe have the CHTC on campus which is a high performing computer cluster„ÄÇ

 however this would require I think more like more experience from your side like it would be more something for later research projects if you don't have experience with Linux yet it might be a very steep learning curve in addition to everything we use in the class„ÄÇ

Here in our yeah lecture class„ÄÇ So in that wayÔºå I think to get goingÔºå if you're new to everything„ÄÇ

 these are definitely more beginner friendly„ÄÇAlrightÔºå so he has a lot of options„ÄÇ

 Some of them have a fixed number of three hoursÔºå or they give you a start creditÔºå for example„ÄÇ

3$300 of credit for these types of things„ÄÇAnd at the bottom I also wanted to mention there is„ÄÇ

 I think yeahÔºå there is more stuff„ÄÇ So also especially for students„ÄÇ

 there are some extra special offers which are also super nice„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_1.png)

So for simplicityÔºå I will walk you through„ÄÇGoogle ColllÔºå how we can use Google Co for project„ÄÇ

So let me click on this„ÄÇAnd then it should yeah open up a new notebook here„ÄÇ

 So notice that this is a notebook environment„ÄÇ It'sÔºå yeahÔºå it's a blessing and occurs„ÄÇ

 Note environments are easy to use„ÄÇ and what's nice is you can also see the results in there„ÄÇ

 but as code becomes more complicated„ÄÇ Sometimes a cloud environment would be also nice where you have Python scripts„ÄÇ

 But yeahÔºå you can explore the list and see what's best suited for you ultimately it's really up to you what you want to use for your class projects„ÄÇ

 So there's no requirement using one environment over the other„ÄÇ It's really up to you„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_3.png)

Because this is relatively beginnerÔºå friendlyyÔºå let me cover this one here„ÄÇ

 So one important thing if you want to use this yeah is to actually select a GPU to make it available for that you have to go to runtime„ÄÇ

And then change runtime type and then choose GPU„ÄÇ You can also use T PUus„ÄÇ

 but I recommend for this class to use GP„ÄÇ

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_5.png)

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_6.png)

AlrightÔºå so and then we can check if Pythr is available„ÄÇSoÔºå let me type„ÄÇTorch„ÄÇAnd then torch dots„ÄÇ

VersionÔºå just to see„ÄÇI't know why it's so slow„ÄÇ It's loading 1„ÄÇ7Ôºå which is a recent one„ÄÇ

 which is nice„ÄÇ And alsoÔºå I think this is like a Google specific thing because usually that is something that doesn't show up when you import torch on your normal computer„ÄÇ

 I think this just means that it has coa 10„ÄÇ1 support„ÄÇAlso„ÄÇ

 just to make sure that it indeed recognizes that GPU„ÄÇsorryrryÔºå good on„ÄÇÊ≤°‰∫Ü‰∏çÔºü

Just to make sure it show's trueÔºå for example„ÄÇWe just try this If the GPU is not available„ÄÇ

 It should return„ÄÇ or did I save thisÔºå It should return„ÄÇFalults„ÄÇYepÔºå so if you see faults„ÄÇ

 make sure you have„ÄÇGPU checked here„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇNow„ÄÇWhat we can do is we can open notebooks so we can„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå add a new notebook„ÄÇ

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_8.png)

So it's a new window here okayÔºå that might be also that's what I wanted to know open a notebook so you can actually open notebooks directly from GitHub„ÄÇ

 so for exampleÔºå you could technically go to our class repository here and then let's choose what we cover last on Tuesday so„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_10.png)

A a line with autograd and Pythrchs using that one„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_12.png)

So I'm opening that here andÔºå oh I'm copying it„ÄÇ And then I can directly have the link here„ÄÇ

 So which is very nice„ÄÇ So I can„ÄÇYou needs to search it first„ÄÇ YeahÔºå I can directly open it„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 I think„ÄÇCan click on it„ÄÇStay on pageÔºå this was not the right one„ÄÇYeahÔºå let me try this again„ÄÇ

Think I need to click this one„ÄÇ

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_14.png)

Open notebook and new tab„ÄÇ OkayÔºå sounds good„ÄÇ So yeah„ÄÇ

 here we have now our yeah code so I can choose the runtime„ÄÇThe GPU„ÄÇAnd then we can actually run it„ÄÇ

 right„ÄÇ So upÔºå let's do it„ÄÇ

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_16.png)

WatmarkÔºå this didn't work„ÄÇ OhÔºå okayÔºå so this is a warning message because it's a notebook note from Google„ÄÇ

 just like a warning Let's say run anyway„ÄÇ

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_18.png)

![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_19.png)

OkayÔºå so we get an error„ÄÇ What is the error„ÄÇ Module watermark has not been found„ÄÇ

 So this is because Google Col comes with some packages pre installedÔºå butÔºå of course„ÄÇ

 it doesn't have every possibleyon Python package pre installed„ÄÇ

 So some packages we have to install ourselves„ÄÇ It's actually not too complicated„ÄÇ We can just„ÄÇ

Use this exclamation markÔºå which is a yeah terminal command for executing a bash terminal command„ÄÇ

 so we can runÔºå for exampleÔºå Pip install„ÄÇ So Pip install„ÄÇMomarkÔºå and then it should„ÄÇInstall it„ÄÇYep„ÄÇ

 so it's loading it and then successfully installed„ÄÇ and then this should work„ÄÇRightÔºå this works„ÄÇ

 So this is just a general way of how you can install packages„ÄÇ

 then if you have packages that are not already installed in Google Colll„ÄÇOkayÔºå moving on„ÄÇ

Loing torch or pay torchÔºå now loading our data set„ÄÇOopsÔºå another problem„ÄÇ So yeah„ÄÇ

 the thing is we loaded the notebookÔºå but we didn't not load the dataÔºå right„ÄÇ

 So if I go back here to the repositoryÔºå there's this data sets subholderer with a iris data set„ÄÇ

 which this notebook doesn't know about Because the link is this one here„ÄÇ So how„ÄÇ

 how can it know where to load the data from„ÄÇ I meanÔºå one way would be for CV files to just„ÄÇCopy„ÄÇ

The link„ÄÇHereÔºå this should work„ÄÇI guess„ÄÇItLoing because pandas can load directly from CV file„ÄÇ

 So this worked„ÄÇSo I can just show you that„ÄÇTrain should be loaded„ÄÇBut usually in practice„ÄÇ

 consider a case where you have a data set that is not on Github that is maybe on your computer„ÄÇ

 and it's also not a C V„ÄÇ So you want to have a more general solution„ÄÇ

 So how can you do that for thatÔºå you have to mount your„ÄÇGoogle Drive folder„ÄÇ

 So this is a little bit complicated„ÄÇ I willÔºå or I have already actually put together some slides that I will share with you after recording this video„ÄÇ

 so„ÄÇAssume we have this data set locally„ÄÇ Let's download this here„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_21.png)

So I'm downloading it right nowÔºå so then I'm opening it here„ÄÇAnd then let me go to my Google Drive„ÄÇ

 So I have a Google Drive folder hereÔºå my drive„ÄÇ and then I have„ÄÇSubholderer call notebooks„ÄÇ

 This should be originally or automatically generated„ÄÇ actuallyÔºå let me save this notebook„ÄÇ

So it says cannot sha same changes„ÄÇ And this is because„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇ

 we we don't have permission for saving it yet„ÄÇ So we have to make a copy„ÄÇ

 So it means basically doesn't„ÄÇIt's loadedud directly from Github„ÄÇ

 It doesn't allow us to override the Github repositoryÔºå which makes sense„ÄÇ

 So let's make a copy of this in our Google Drive„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇIt's completed„ÄÇ OkayÔºå new tap„ÄÇ

So this is our copy of Adeline„ÄÇ If I load this directory nowÔºå or if I refresh this Google collapsese„ÄÇ

 you will see here„ÄÇ This is now in my call notebooks folder„ÄÇ So you can also directly„ÄÇGo here„ÄÇ

If you have code on your computer and just drag and drop it here„ÄÇ

And then you can go right click open with Google Collaboratory„ÄÇ that is also a way to do that„ÄÇNow„ÄÇ

 assume I have my data set„ÄÇThat I want to connect with my notebook„ÄÇSo I„ÄÇ

 let's say I have a data set here on my hard drive or whole data folder„ÄÇ I can just„ÄÇ

Take that and also drag and drop that here„ÄÇSo it's now dataÔºå data sets„ÄÇ So it's the same structure„ÄÇ

As shown here„ÄÇSo it's next to my notebook„ÄÇSo let's see if we can load it now„ÄÇToo many sessionsÔºå Okay„ÄÇ

 let me close this one„ÄÇThis one„ÄÇOkay there are still too many sessions„ÄÇOkay„ÄÇ

 let me terminate this one into this one„ÄÇAnd maybe also this one„ÄÇRight„ÄÇLet's try again„ÄÇNow it works„ÄÇ

Okay„ÄÇSo technicallyÔºå we might thinkÔºå okayÔºå we can load the data now because it is relative to our notebooking in this dataset sub folder„ÄÇ

 So it's located hereÔºå rightÔºå howeverÔºå in practice theres still a file not found error and this is because yeah„ÄÇ

 that's like a little quirk„ÄÇ we have to mount our Google drive to or into this notebook„ÄÇ

So how we do thatÔºå if I recallÔºå it's from Google dot call up„ÄÇImplo„ÄÇMountÔºå and then„ÄÇsorry„ÄÇRight„ÄÇ

I think it's sorry from Google imported drive and then drive„ÄÇMo„ÄÇAnd then„ÄÇ



![](img/d7c7154ac9fc0d0d61b5e647f19bec0d_23.png)

Let me just look this up because I've actually made my slidesÔºå just to make sure„ÄÇ

I type the right thing here„ÄÇOkayÔºå my content and drive„ÄÇ interesting„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so from„ÄÇ

Google dot call up import driveÔºå and then mount„ÄÇContent„ÄÇRight„ÄÇ

 I will share the slides with you after this video so we can do this„ÄÇ

Then it asks us to enter an authorization codeÔºå which we can do by following this linkÔºå me„ÄÇ

Conrm this„ÄÇYep„ÄÇThen I can copy this and it here„ÄÇAlrightÔºå this is my authorization code„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ

 it should be mounted„ÄÇTake some time„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now it should work„ÄÇ So let me„ÄÇNot the data„ÄÇ

 still a file not found„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so the reason is we have now mounted this drive„ÄÇ

 but it is it requires a little bit more information about that because the notebook„ÄÇ

 you can think of it„ÄÇ It sits in some arbitrary replace on a Google server„ÄÇ

 and this data sits on my Google drive„ÄÇ So you have to be a bit more specific and provide a concrete address„ÄÇ

 So it would be„ÄÇLet's see content„ÄÇMy„ÄÇüòîÔºåAnd then„ÄÇCollup„ÄÇüòîÔºå„Éâ„ÉÉ„ÇØ„Çπ„ÄÇSo this is essentially„ÄÇ

If you follow hereÔºå my driveÔºå Google call notebooks and then data sets„ÄÇ

 So this is what we have here now„ÄÇ so this should now work„ÄÇSeeÔºå this„ÄÇFinally worked„ÄÇ

It seems a little bit complicatedÔºå but technically it's not that complicated„ÄÇ

 I showed you a lot of things that don't work to motivate or to do it here step by step„ÄÇ

 but technically you can also just leave these lines in your notebook and then it should work so you only have to do it once if you and then for the next project you can copy and paste it„ÄÇ

But there is also one little addition I want to make and that is„ÄÇ

There are two computers involved here right nowÔºå or at least to server„ÄÇ

 One is Google Drive where your dataset is sitting and one is this notebook that is running on a different computer instance at Google and the communication between those computers can be a little bit snow because it goes over the Internet„ÄÇ

 So to speed things up when we work with more complicated data sets„ÄÇ

 it's actually better to copy this data„ÄÇTo the same computer that is running this notebook„ÄÇ So„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå what you could do is you can do on„ÄÇA copypyÔºå so„ÄÇCan say„ÄÇBe dream„ÄÇSo you can copy„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇ

 that's what I want„ÄÇYou can copy these data sets here„ÄÇTo a local folder for data sets„ÄÇ

So you copied itÔºå and then you can againÔºå use the original link„ÄÇAnd if you have large data sets„ÄÇ

 the training will be faster when we use Pythtorge data loads if the data is located locally like that„ÄÇ

 So here I just copied it from Google Drive„ÄÇTo this local directory called data sets„ÄÇ

 So this is what I would recommend„ÄÇ And even further than that„ÄÇ

 I would actually recommend if you have more complicated data sets to make a zip fileÔºå so„ÄÇHere„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå in my caseÔºå I can just goÔºå go hereÔºå compress data sets„ÄÇ

I have this dataset sets dot zip fileÔºå and then I go to this folder hereÔºå and„ÄÇDrag and drop it here„ÄÇ

So it's now datas„ÄÇ zip„ÄÇAnd then„ÄÇI go here„ÄÇAnd instead of copy3Ôºå because it's a single file„ÄÇ

 I will just copy data sets dot zip„ÄÇTo have just„ÄÇI zipÔºå so I'm just copying it here„ÄÇ

And then I can unzip itÔºå unzip„ÄÇZip„ÄÇI need an excation mark because this is not a Python command„ÄÇ

 This is a bash terminal command„ÄÇAnd it asks me to overrite this because I already have a data set like this in my„ÄÇ

Drive„ÄÇSo yeahÔºå this should„ÄÇWork nowÔºå OkayÔºå so in this then also„ÄÇIn that way„ÄÇ

 this is my recommended way using the zip file and then unzippbit it on on this machine„ÄÇ Of course„ÄÇ

 for something simple like IisÔºå it's overkillÔºå but later we will see we will be working with data las and„ÄÇ

 for exampleÔºå large image data sets like Ms where you have 50000 images and it is just faster to upload„ÄÇ

Or copy a single file and then unpack it compared to uploading 50000 files like small little files„ÄÇ

 So in this wayÔºå it's like my recommended approach„ÄÇ If you use Google Colll„ÄÇ AlrightÔºå so this is„ÄÇ

 yeahÔºå then how you used the GPU„ÄÇ ActuallyÔºå we haven't used the GPU in this notebook here yet„ÄÇ

Just to quickly continue„ÄÇ So if you wanted to use the GPUÔºå you have to do one additional step„ÄÇ

 You have to„ÄÇToch device„ÄÇUse the GPUÔºå actually„ÄÇ So there's only one GPU in this computer„ÄÇ

 So we use the index 0Ôºå which stands for the first GPU„ÄÇ This one would be the second GPUÔºå third GPU„ÄÇ

 fourth GPU and the fourth Yes only one GPU„ÄÇ so we can just oops„ÄÇTransfer it to the one GPU„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇOh„ÄÇ

 okay„ÄÇ so one issue is this is our manual implementation„ÄÇ So thisÔºå of course„ÄÇ

 doesn't support the GPU because it's not using the model class„ÄÇ So let me„ÄÇYeah„ÄÇ

 doing this very spontaneously here„ÄÇ Let me run this regularly„ÄÇAnd then go to the automatic one„ÄÇ

So order line automaticallyÔºå this is the one using module„ÄÇ So if you do that„ÄÇThenÔºå this one„ÄÇ

Will technically support the GPU„ÄÇ So we do this one„ÄÇAnd thenÔºå it should„ÄÇRun on the GPU„ÄÇ

 We have to make one more modification for the training data set„ÄÇ I assume We'll see if that runs„ÄÇ

AlrightÔºå so yeahÔºå seeÔºå it says some argument is on the CPU while it's expected to be on the GPU„ÄÇ

 So that is because we also have the same to do the same thing for the data set„ÄÇSoÔºå let me see„ÄÇ

I assume we can simply„ÄÇÂóØ„ÄÇDo the same thing„ÄÇFor this oneÔºå and„ÄÇ‰∏∫‰ªÄ‰πàÔºüLet me a typo here„ÄÇOh yeah one„ÄÇMi„ÄÇ

 so now it works„ÄÇ So I also transferred the data to the GPU„ÄÇ If you have the model on the GPU„ÄÇ

 it also as expects the data to be on the GPU„ÄÇ So in the later code examples„ÄÇ

 I will have a flag to do this automatically where you only have at the top of the script„ÄÇ

 where you only have to specify it once„ÄÇAnd then it will automatically update it everywhere where you wanted to use the correct device„ÄÇ

 AlrightÔºå so yeahÔºå let is just a quick tutorial how to use the GPU„ÄÇ

 I have also these slides here for the Google Colll and I will also upload them„ÄÇ

 So I hope that was useful and let me know if you have any questions„ÄÇ
