We're gonna look at four different algebraic tricks that are very useful for computing limits。

 So we're going to investigate these four particular limits。

 and they're going be a different algebraic trick for each of them。

 let's start off with something pretty easy， Let's just do good old factoring。

 When I look at this particular limit。 The first thing I might think is， hold on。

 do I need to do any algebraic tricks at all。 Well。

 what happens if I take this value of -2 and actually plug it into the limit。 Well。

 if you just evaluate the top and the bottom at the value of -2。 You're gonna to get0 divided by 0。

 you're going to get an indeterminate form。 So we have to do some algebraic trick。

 I have to do something to just not have a0 divided by0。

 So the first thing I notice when I look at it is I've got x's everywhere。

 So why don' I just factor out in x from the top and factor out in x from the bottom。

 And that's gonna leave something like this。 And I can cancel those x's。

 But I still have a quadratic that is still0 on the top， but it's still zero on the bottom。

 So I's to go a little bit further。😊，Qudratic， the x squared minus x minus-6。

 I can factor that as being the limit as x goes to 2 of x plus2 times x minus3 on the top and then another copy of x plus2 on the bottom as in factoring the quadratic to get a product of two linear terms。

 Well now when I look at it， it's way nicer because I've got an x plus2 on the top。

 I've got an x plus2 on the bottom， I can cancel those。

 And what I'm then left with is just the limit of x minus3。Now all the way along here。

 I never plugged in the x equal to minus2 because it would give me a0 over0 but now I've canceled enough that I can plug in the value of minus2。

 there was no longer a zero divided by zero scenario and so I can just plug it in and get minus5 Now just a couple points about notation noticeice that I have an equal sign in front of every single one of these limits that's an unbroken chain of equal and notice that I have a limit sign in front of every single one of them until that final step where I plug in the value of minus2 and I'm not allowed to plug in the minus2 earlier because it would just be zero over0 would be an indeterminate form。

Alright， factoring was our first example。 Let's look at the next one。 This one is expanding。

 sort of the opposite of factoring in some sense。 I have the quadratic here root it as x 2 squared。

 Let's go and expand that out。 Let's write it as x -2 times in x -2。 Well。

 if I multiply that out on the numerator， I'm going to get x squared-4 x plus 4。

 then subtract off the 4 I already had on the top and have to change the denominator。Now。

 the reason this is nice here is that in this example。

 the plus4 and the minus four cancels so those can go away。Well。

 I'm still not done because even if I get rid of the plus4-4 part。

 I still can't plug in 0 yet because it's gonna be a 0 over 0 is gonna to be once again in a termminant。

 So what can I do。 It's the same trick we just saw when we look at a factory。

 There's lots of x is around， let's factor out an x。 So if I factor out an x and cancel it。

 then I've just x-4 remaining with an x on the top and bottom we get rid of those is just the x-4。

 and finally， I can evaluate the limit。 I can plug in the0。 and I get -4。 So again。

 another unbroken chain of qualities with a limit in front of every single one of the expressions except the last one where I finally go and evaluate the limit。

😊，So factoring and expanding the were kind of similar。

 but now let's go and look at common denominators， which is quite a bit of a different trim。

So in this example， I have a difference of two different things， a difference of two fractions。

Each of the fractions is individually problematic， so for example the limited that goes to zero with just one over x by itself does not exist。

So whenever you have a difference of two of these things where they both do not exist or they're going to be infinite。

 this means we have to do something else and when it's written in in fractionction form。

 a common denominator is a useful trick。So what I do is I multiply both sides by the other denominator and I put them all together。

😡，The general formula for finding this denominator is if you've got A over B plus C over D。

 then you can put them together as A D plus BC over BD， it's cross multiplication。😡，Now。

 I've got this。 Let's see whether it's actually any nicer for us。 Well， indeed。

 notice I've got a plus 2 x and a-2 x， I can cancel those。 Okay， so if we cancel those。

 I'm just left to a bunch of x squared on the top and execute cubed plus 2 x on the bottom。 Not bad。

😊，But again， I cannot plug an x equal to 0。 again， it's indetermant。 again， it's zero divided by 0。

 I have to go back to my first algebraic trick of factor。 So let's factor out。 Well。

 it's x squared on the top。 So how will we factor out an x squared。 Certainly。

 there's an x squared and all the terms on the denominator x squared or higher。

 So if I factor out the x squared。 I'm just gonna get a one on the top and an x plus two on the bottom。

 Now it's not zero divided by0。 So now I can plug it in。 and I just get the value of a half。😊。

All right， we're doing pretty good here， that's three tricks down time for the fourth。

 this is called the radical conjugate。The radical conjugate applies in scenarios where you've got this either a plus or minus。

 but with a square root in it。Note that if I just plug in the value of  four be zero on the top and zero on the bottoms I have to do something and what I'm going to do is I'm going to multiply by just one。

😡，But not just one， a very fancy version of one， a very specific version of one。

 you see oh it's square root x minus2， and then we multiply the top on the bottom by square root x plus2。

Because it's the top and the bottom， this is just multiplication by one， it's totally fine。

In general， if you're gonna to have a square root A plus or minus a square root of B。

 you multiply by square root A， and then you reverse the sign。

 I call it minus plus a square root a minus plus square root B divided by square root a minus plus square root B。

 multiply by a fancy version of1。 Now， why is this so nice。

 It's because if I take the numerator here。 And I go and try to multiply it out。

 The cross terms cancel。 In other words， I get the square root x and the square root x。

 they become an x。 The2 and the plus2 becomes a4。 But the other terms。

 the2 square root x and the plus two square root x。 they cancel。

 So all I'm left within the numerator is just x-4。 See how nice ra of conjugates are they take this messy thing with square roots。

 and they make it really simple。 at least on the top。 The bottoms kind of messy。

 I've matched that together。 but it's gonna turn out to be messy in a way。 It's okay。

 because I can just plug the value set。 Well， not yet， I suppose again。

 I cannot plug in for because the zero divided by 0。😊。

I can cancel the x minus-4 on the top and the x minus4 on the bottom。 that's perfectly allowed。

 So if I cancel the x minus4 on the top and the x minus4 on the bottom。

 then I'm just left with the one over square root x plus2 plug in the value of4 and I get a quarter。

Allright， so those are four algebraic tricks that hopefully are going to help you when you're computing algebraic limits。

 but we also use them all the time in calculus， you're going to use them a whole bunch as you go forward and they're just little algebraic ways to make your expressions nicer。
