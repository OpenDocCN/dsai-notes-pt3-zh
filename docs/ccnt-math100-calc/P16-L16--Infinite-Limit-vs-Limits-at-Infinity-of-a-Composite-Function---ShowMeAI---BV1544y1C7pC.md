# P16ï¼šL16- Infinite Limit vs Limits at Infinity of a Composite Function - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to look at a particular functionã€‚

 the function E to this rational functionï¼Œ E to x minus3 divided by x minus2ã€‚

 and what I want to accomplish by the end of this video is to analyze what are all the vertical asymptopes of this particular function and what are all the horizontal onesï¼Ÿ

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Now I've started with a particular limitï¼Œ the limit as x goes to2 from the right and why did I even choose to investigate that limit Wellã€‚

 the reason was that if I look up here at the rational functionã€‚

 the x minus3 divided by x minus2 I see that there is a division by zero occurring at x equal to 2 and that makes me think that perhaps the value of x equal to 2 is a problem for this particular function something I want to investigate so I'm going to do this limit first and we're going to investigate a couple other limits and finally we're going to figure out all the vertical asymptotesã€‚

 all the horizontal ones and come up with a graph of this functionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Allrightï¼Œ so how do I actually investigate this limit first When I look at thisã€‚

 I notice that it's a composition of two different functionsï¼Œ there's an outside functionã€‚

 the E to the whateverï¼Œ and then there's an inside functionã€‚

 this quotient this x minus3 over x minus2 So the first thing I'm going to do knowing that the exponential function is a continuous function is I'm going to investigate the limit as x goes to two from the right of the inside function So let me do that I'm going to look at thisã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Alrightï¼Œ so here I'm investigating the limitï¼Œ as that goes to two from the right of this rational functionã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ what I notice isï¼Œ let's look at the denominator firstã€‚ So if I go and look at the denominatorã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ here we have an x -2ã€‚ and I'm plugging in a value of 2ã€‚ But it's it's not just too exactlyã€‚

 it's 2 from the rightã€‚ So this is a value like 2ã€‚12ã€‚01ï¼Œ2ã€‚001ã€‚



![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_9.png)

![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_10.png)

So for all of those values from the rightï¼Œ this is going to be very close to zero but close and positiveã€‚

 so I'm going to say that this looks a little bit like I'm going to figure out the numerator in a momentã€‚

 but for the denominatorï¼Œ it looks like zero but zero from the rightï¼Œ a little bit positiveã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Okay well that let's investigate what happens in the numerator this is pretty simpleã€‚

 I plug into I get two minus3ã€‚ this is gonna to be a negative value so negative one and I put this in quotation marks because I'm not being rigorous here but I'm just demonstrating what the basic form of the top and the bottom is okay so what is this going to be if you have a negative number on the top a positive on the bottom and because it's a zero on the bottom particular it's spike into infinity in our only task because it plus infinity or minus infinity because of the negative because of the positive this is going to end up being minus infinity Allright so that was the inside now I want to go all the way back to the original what I want to look at E to this particular power in other wordsã€‚

 what I'm effectively looking at is e to the minus infinity because I know that the inside is tending towards minus infinity and so I want to investigate what E to the negative infinity is What's that hereã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼Œhave to remember what the graph of e to the x is in order to be able to answer this and the graph of e to the x looks a little something like thisã€‚

 it starts all the way down here getting very close to zero and spice off like thatã€‚

 so this is the graph of E to the xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ well now we can answer itã€‚

 what's the E to the minus infinity well I'm on the graph of e to the xã€‚

 but I'm looking over here at minus infinity it's getting closer and closer and closer to zeroã€‚

 and so we can say that this is going to be equal to  zeroã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAll rightã€‚

 so that was one limit I might care about the limit as we go to two from the rightã€‚

 And it turns out it's not a vertical asympteã€‚ This limit is just serialã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNext upã€‚

 I'm going to look at the same place tooã€‚ that's the same problem spot that we haveã€‚

 but now I'm looking at two from the left and does that make a big differenceã€‚

 and it turns out that it's going to make a really big difference in this particular caseã€‚ Wellã€‚

 why is that the case Let's do the same computation we just did here for the insideã€‚

 we would start hereï¼Œ but now instead of the plus I'm gonna to have a minus signã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_12.png)

Okayï¼Œ so I've written that down and if I do my sort of what does this look like in terms of positive and negativesã€‚

 Well on the topï¼Œ I'm gonna go and plug in this particular value of  two I still get the 1 as I did beforeã€‚

 but now look what happens on the bottom I'm plugging in2 but2 from the left So number like 1ã€‚91ã€‚991ã€‚

999 So if I subtract2 from all of those they're getting really close to0 but from the left so I'm going write a 0 and I put this little minus sign up here to noteote that it's coming from the leftã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then a division by zero was plus or minus infinityã€‚

 but we have to adjudicate whether it's positive or negative because I've got a minus and another minusã€‚

 I can say that this is going to be infinity Okayï¼Œ so the inside changes a little bit it went from being minus infinity in the first case to plus infinity in the second caseã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo then when I come and investigate this what we're going to haveã€‚

 this is just going to be the same thing as an E to the power of plus infinity this timeã€‚

I go and take a look at what that's gonna to look like on the graph as I go to positive infinityã€‚

 It is spiking to positive infinityã€‚ And so indeed this is gonna to be positive infinityã€‚

 So now we can claim that there is indeed a vertical aymptone at this particular point of X going to2 from the leftã€‚

 even though from the rightï¼Œ it was going to a finite number 0 from the left it goes to infinity So we have a vertical aymptoteã€‚

 So those were the vertical asymptesã€‚ But what about the horizontal asymptes a horizontal asympts is what happens at either plus infinity or minus infinityã€‚

 So that's what I'm going to do I'm can take first the limit as we go to positive infinity of the same functionã€‚

 and then in a moment I'll do negative infinityã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_15.png)

And it's the same ideaï¼Œ there' is the outside functionã€‚

 there's the inside function and because E to the x is continuous I'm going to go and do the inside function first and feed that into the outside functionã€‚

 so let me write that downã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_17.png)

![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_18.png)

![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_19.png)

Rational functionsï¼Œ quots of polynomials are actually pretty easy to compute limits at plus or minus infinityã€‚

 When I look at thisï¼Œ I say what's the highest power of x on the topã€‚

 What's the highest power of x on the bottomã€‚ and in this case is actually relatively straightforwardã€‚

 There's x to the power of one on the top and x to the power of one on the bottomã€‚

 the highest power is the sameã€‚ And so I look at the coefficientsã€‚

 The coefficient of the first x is1ï¼Œ the coefficient of the second x is1ã€‚

 And so this infinite limit is just equal to the value of1ã€‚ So now that I know the insideã€‚

 I can come along and I can feed it in up hereã€‚ if I have this E to the power of whatever that's gonna beã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ that goes to1ã€‚ So this is e to the1ã€‚ And so e to the1 or in other wordsï¼Œ Eã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d5d9beb7287bd0d494a4d6b799ee706_21.png)

And so we have this one horizontal asymptoe it's got the equation y because it's a height y equals e and that is a horizontal asymptoe at positive infinity Well what about negative infinity now it's got the same inside here but it would be at minus infinity but does not change anything I don't think soã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThis is just an X over an x the highest powers they cancelï¼Œ it's one either wayã€‚

 so indeed the infinity that I had hereï¼Œ I can replace it with plus or minus infinity either way this happens to equal 1 note that this is not always the case if I had something like for exampleã€‚

 a square root here could be the case that limit positive infinity and minus infinity we' different but in this case they're both oneã€‚

 and then if I feed this into here it's going to be e to the1 and so I'm going to get the value E to the one or other words Eã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo I've got these two different horizontal asymptesã€‚

 All right so summarizing the four limits we've computed we saw that when we took two from the rightã€‚

 it was a finite number0 when it was two from the left it was a vertical asymptote infinity And then when we took the horizontal asympoteesã€‚

 either positive infinity or minus infinity either of them gave the value of E So we have these horizontal asytes at y equal to E So what would the graph of this thing look like okay I'm going bring it up hereã€‚

 This is the graphã€‚ notice what happens first at2ã€‚ when I'm coming from the rightã€‚

 So I'm coming over here from the rightï¼Œ it goes right down and hits the value of0ã€‚

 that's what we expectedã€‚ not a vertical aympts' just a finite valueï¼Œ the value of0ã€‚

 but then if I come over here from the left as I'm going towards2 So going towards two but from the leftã€‚

 I actually do indeed get that vertical asymptesã€‚ so I get the vertical asymptote from the leftã€‚

 even though from the right it's just going down to0ã€‚

Okay what about the horizontal laines where you can sort of see we might not be quite zoomed in enough A seal is just sort of flattening and outã€‚

 flattening out this value that looks like two point something rather Well it's quite believable that as you go larger than just the six that we see hereã€‚

 that's going level out at the value of E say as we go down here it's going to eventually level out at the value of E we have this two different horizontal laints on both sides equaling E knowing when a limit happens to be equal to infinity that is a vertical lainte or knowing what the horizontal laintes are that is when the limits go to plus or minus infinityã€‚

 it allows you to have a really nice sort of big picture of the shape of the graphsã€‚

 simply knowing these sort of four pieces of information tells us quite a lot about the basic shape of the graph it is very invaluable for us to quickly understand what's going on in a functionã€‚
