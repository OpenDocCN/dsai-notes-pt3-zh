I wanted to record a video saying basically two different things。

 and the first of is the more important。 And that's to say thank you。

 we in this math department here at UC are doing an experiment this year where we're taking half of the sections and we're trying this big flip class model。

 I've been doing flip class for a little while here at UC。

 but we've sort of pushed it out into grander scale and I have to say that personally， I have really。

 really， really enjoyed it。 And I've really enjoyed that I think that all of you have done a pretty big ask and that's this。

 you' come to class for the most part it's actually been really good。

 you've come to class ready and willing and able to work on a whole bunch of problems that you've actually been watched some videos and you've done some pre-class ahead of time and then in class you're actually working and you're talking with each other and you're learning mathematics and you're not just sort of sitting back and you're not just sort of observing me do mathematics。

 You're actually taking the much harder tasks， which is that you're doing mathematics yourselves。

 And and first of all， I think that's really important for of a point for you to sort of really internalized。

😊，As you go on in your future careers， I think it's really important that you do as much active learning yourself where you're trying to make sense of things but what I really appreciate and the reason why I want to thank you is that you're coming here to to the first year for a very large number of you here at university。

 your first semester for a large number of you and you're just really dove in head first and really tackle this class and had a really great attitude and it was a really nice buzz in the room and I just really loved it I just had a really wonderful experience and I really enjoyed it so I hope that you did as well。

And then the second thing I want to talk about is course evaluations Now there's been a whole bunch of different surveys for this sort of study of this calculus course but course evaluations there for me。

 there let my boss and my boss's boss and people here at the university know how I'm doing how my performance as a teacher is what you guys think of me and this has actually important it for a couple different reasons first of all。

 I have improved an enormous amount in my own teaching based on the teaching evaluations that I've gotten for the last many。

 many years of my teaching career and indeed there's all sorts of things that I used to do or not do at the beginning of my career that now I do and I've really changed and I will read every one of your comments and I will analyze your little statistics I'm really going to sort of put a little portion of my heart into the course evaluations I take them really seriously and every single semester I have found things in the course evaluations to improve on and to make a difference in my own teaching and I really truly and the teacher I am today in part because。

Course evaluation。 So I want to hear from you。 I want to know what you like what you didn't like。

 what we can do better。 what was already going well。

 I like that validation and gives me good insight into the future。

 And then it's also just it's the big thing that matters for me professionally。 I'm a teacher。

 I'm an assistant professor educator， which means that my fulltime role is in teaching and it's very important for us。

 educators is we go up and as we get promoted that our course evaluations are actually decent and reflect things。

 But of course， we only want that to be decent if it's true and our teacher actually is decent。

 So what I would love to do is that you take them seriously， that's the most important thing。

 I want you to go and write a course evaluation。 And I want you to write a course evaluation that you think is honest that reflects how I am as a teacher and what can be done differently and what you say is same。

 So I would really appreciate you do that I'll leave a link out in the description and it needs to be done by next Sunday。

 So I believe that's the third。😊，For your last and final thing。 Next semester， I'm out of here。

 I'm on paternity leave。 I'm not coming in。 I'm not teaching classes。 I know it's set。

 I'm gonna to miss all of you。 That's for sure。 I wish you the best on calculus too。 absolutely。

 I will say， however， I have done this flip class for in calculus too And I do have a playlist already build and waiting for you。

 if you want to go， you can subscribe to the channel and you can check out the videos that I made in my flip class last year。

 if that's gonna be help you。 I'll warn you didn't have all the fancy technology that I have right now。

 but at content wise， I still thought they are pretty good。 So best of luck to your future。

 best of luck for the file exam， please fill out a course evaluation and I'll see you guys around leaving up to the final exam。

😊。
