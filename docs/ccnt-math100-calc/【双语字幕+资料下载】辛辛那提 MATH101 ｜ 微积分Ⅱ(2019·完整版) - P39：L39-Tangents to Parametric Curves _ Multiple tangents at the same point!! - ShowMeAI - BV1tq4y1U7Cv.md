When we've studied calculus in the past， there's many different geometric notions that we're interested in。

 for example， the slope of a tangent line， the area under a curve， the arc length of a curve。

 But when we did calculus before we were always doing it for curves of the form。

 Y is a function of X。 But now what we want to do is repeat a lot of that。

 But in the context of a parametric curve。 So instead of y is a function of x。

 you have x is a function of t and y a function of t that both of the coordinates are functions of an independent parameter。

 we normally call T。 So， for example， in this particular graph。

 we've got x of t is t squared and y of t is t cubed minus3 T。 So this is a parametric curve。

 And what we see is that we have a tangent line to that curve at some point， the question is。

 what is the equation of that tangent line。 Now， one of the things that becomes apparent when you start studying parametric curve is that it's actually a bit richer than it used to be in the past。

 So， for example， let me consider the tangent lines。😊，Specifically at this point。

 x equal to 3 and y equal to 0。 Now， what is interesting about this 30 point is that well。

 there's this one tangent line here。 Imagine I go all the way around the loop。

 and what you're going to see is there's actually a second tangent line at that particular spot。

 That is to say that at this30， we have a sort of cross behavior that there's two different tangent lines that both could be written down。

 This is a richness that occurs for parametric curve。

 but didn't occur when they were all written y as a function of x where they had to pass a vertical line test。

 This clearly is going to fail a vertical line test。 So what can we do。 Well。

 let me consider an arbitrary x of t and a y of T， some parametric curve。 Now。

 let me consider the chain rule applied to D Y Dt。 because X is an intermediate variable here。

 The Y depends on x， but then the x depends itself on T。 I can apply the chain rule。

 And what I get is a D Y D X， D X， D T。In I rearrange this formula。

 It's going to become nothing but D Y D X is the quotient of D Y D T by D X D T。

 At least this is going to be true in the scenario where the Dx D T is non0。

 where the denominator is non0。 So this gives me a formula to compute D Y D X。

 which is the slope of the tangent line。 If I know my x of t in my y of T。

 I take their derivatives and take a quotient。 So， for example。

 in the curves that we were studying before this x of T is t squared and this y is t cubed3 T。

 If I want to compute D Y D X is just going to be this quotient in the numerator。

 you get the y prime， which is3 t squared3 in the denominator to get2 T。

 I want to I can just clean it up a little bit of algebra 3s T minus1 over t。

 So this tells me the slope of the tangent line at some specific value of T。 Well。

 let's use this in the larger conis of the problem。 So here's the same curve I have。

 And I put up the two different tangent lines。 And my question is。

What are the equations of the tangent lines at this point 30。

 and we can visually see that there's going to be two of them？Well。

 the first thing we need to do is figure out， well hold on， if x is 3 and y is0。

 what's the value of t at this point？We can actually just plug this into the formula。

 So x of t is known to be t squared。 If I set that equal to 3。

 that's going to tell me that t is equal to plus or minus root 3。 Now， this is actually enough。

 but let's just do a quick check and see if it worked out for y as well。

 So why I could factor as t times t cubed -3， If I set that equal to 0。

 Remember y is 0 in this point，30， then I get either t equal to 0 or again。

 t is plus or minus root 3， the same plus or minus root 3 we had before。

 The case when t is equal to 0。 by the way， that's going to represent the 0，0 point in my curve。

So the argument here is that this specific case where x is equal to 3 that has two different values of T that represent that。

 you hit it once and then you sort of go around the loop and you hit it a second time at a different value of T。

So now let's take those t values and plug them into the slope that we computed out before。

 recall that when we looked at what， say the derivative D Y D X was， we got this3 Ha T -1 over T。

 Now， I'm going to evaluate at first at t equal to the positive square root of 3。 P that number。

 and I get this。😊，I see this root 3 in the numerator。 I want to get a common denominator。

 So I'm going to rewrite that as three over root 3。 Then if I look at the numerators。

 there's a  three-1， which is just going to be the same thing as a two third。

 the twos canceled and then it three over root 3， I can replace that just with root 3。 All right。

 same story for plugging in N t equal to minus square root of 3。

 you can plug that in and you get minus- square root 3 as well。

 by the way it's just a complete coincidence that when you have t with a root 3。

 the output is root 3， when you plug t with a minus root3， the output is minus root 3。

 that's just a coincidence of this particular problem。 regardless。

 what I'm now going to do is try to figure out， Well， I have the slope。 But what about the equations。

 So let me remind you that the equation of a tangent line is given by the point slope formula。

 If I have a specific point， that's not Y not that's being chosen。😊。

Then if I know what the slope the M value is， I can plug it into this y minus y n is M x minus x not formula。

 And that's going to give me the equation of a tangent。 So here， the x naught is the 3。

 and the y naught is the 0。 And then the M is either plus root 3 or root 3。

 So if I plug those into the formula。 I get these two different equations。

 Y equals root 3 times x -3。 and y is equal to plus root 3 times x -3。Final note， remember that D， Y。

 D X， I could apply the chain rule， except in that scenario where Dx D T was equal to 0。

 But what happens at that point when Dx D T was equal to 0， this is when t equal to 0。

 and that occurs at this point。 the 0，0 that we have over here。 Well。

 that's where you have a vertical tangent。 So in this video。

 we've managed to go and take the problem of finding equations of tangent lines。

 which we knew well how to do in calculus 1 and extend that to parametric curves。😊。
