I'm going begin this video as I have so many other videos on series with the geometric series that all important geometric series。

 But this time I'm doing a slight shift to my notation。 It's not the sum of R to the power of n。

 the ratio R。's the sum of x to the power N where I'm using x instead of R。

 Now there's a reason for this。 Well， it's symbolically just a transformation。

 it's just the same geometric series you know and love。 but now when I use x。

 I'm thinking that this is really a function of x。 you give me an x in between -1 and1。

 and I can tell you what the function that is the series is going to spit out。

 it's going spit out1 over 1 minus x。 If you give me an x。

 which is outside of-1 to1 Its just not defined。 So this is a function with a fixed domain。

 the domain between -1 and1。 So let me take that idea。

 and let's extend even further to something that we call power series。 So a power series。😊。

like a geometric series in a couple different ways， instead of x to the n。

 I'm going to have x minus a to the n， that's not so very different it's just sort of a shift。

But I also multiply it not by one every time or by a constant A every time。

 but by an entire other sequence C N， C N could be one over n or n factorial or who knows。

 So power series is when you have a variable X raised to power of n may be shifted by the A。

 and then multiplied by a sequence of constants like one over n or one over n squared or whatever you like。

 Now， the point is this power series is a function that if you put in different values of x。

 you may get convergence， you get a value out of it。

 Or it may divergge in which case the function is not defined for that value of x。 But either way。

 if's a function of x with some domain that we want to figure out。So for instance。

 let's make this concrete by considering a specific example。In this example， the C N。

 that constant sequence is the sequence 1 over N。 And then I have an x minus2 to the power of n。 Now。

 depending on what the x is， this may converge or it may diverge。 It depends on that value of x。

 So how can we decide whether this diverges or converges。 But we have the ratio test。

 this ratio of an plus1 over an， and you put the absolute value。

 take the limit n goes to an afffinity， we can do that and will tell us when this converges。

 And when it doesn't， what values of x make this converge to what values of x make it diverge。

 so let's plug this in。 if I plug that into my ratio on the top I have the an。

 What I put an n plus 1 everywhere。 So x -2 to the n plus1 over n plus 1。

 And then I divide out just by the A。 I have a quotient of quotient。

 So I'll bring the bottom one up and what this is just going give me is the limit of an x-2 to the n plus 1 over x 2 to the。

And then multiplied by an n over an n plus1， that's what I get when I bring it up。😡，Now。

 for the yellow， the n over the n plus1， as n gets very large。

 that is just going to go to the value of one。Then for the x minus2 portion because it's x minus 2 to the n plus 1 and then x minus2 to the n。

 most of those cancel， and I'm just left with a single copy of this x minus2 multiplied by the one。

So simplifying a little bit， I have my limit of my ratios is equal to the absolute value of x minus2。

 and I'll remind you that what the ratio test told us is it gave us conditions for when that ratio was going to imply that the series converged absolutely or whether it divrged or whether it was inconclusive。

😡，So if this ratio is less than one， that's when it's going to co converge and if the ratio is equal to one。

 well it might still converge， but we'll have to do more work。

 we don't yet know for us from the ratio test。So let's do this。 We know that our ratio goes to x -2。

 So if it converges， that means it's going to be x -2 is less than1。

 This is an inequality with an absolute value。 It has a center of2。 It has a radius of one。

 So it's all points that are one away from that center of 2。

 which is to say that the ratio test is telling us。

 It converges If we are on the interval from one up to 3。Now。

 that is when the ratio test guaranteed it converged。

 but it might converge for even more values of x than that because there's also the inconclusive case。

 So how do we deal with that？ What happens when the absolute value of x minus-2 is not just less than1 but equal to1。

 Indeed， it's possible that it also converges there if it's greater than one ratio test says for sure it's going to diverge。

 So let's go back to our original series， And we already know what converges on the1 up to3。

 we want to see if we can do better than that。😡，No。When absolute value of x -2 is equal to 1。

 this occurs at two different times。 If x is equal to 3， the one endpoint， or if x is equal to 1。

 the other endpoint， either of those are going to take the absolute value and make them equal to 1。

 So let's probably just plug in them in。 So if I plug in， for example， x equal to1。 Well。

 what do I get， it's -1 to the n over n。That's a series we've seen before。

 That's an alternating series。 This is a series where you've got the minus-1 to the n multiplied by a decreasing positive sequence with limit0。

 this one over n。 So this converges by the alternating series test。

 So indeed it's not just less than one here and our domain where it converges less than or equal to1 what the other side of this。

 Well if I plug an x equal to 33 minus2 is11 to the n is just always one。

 So this is the sum of1 over n， which is a P test is the harmonic series。

 this divergs So on the one end point it converge and the other it diverged。 So final answer。

 what do we have our interval of convergence is the one less than or equal to the x all the way up to the3 and other pieces of terminology I throw in the mix here is that I will say that the radius of convergence as one and that the center of it is2。

 So I think of this one up to three is center at2 and then you can go off from the value of one on either side。

 So one up to3。😊，And I've checked my endpoints and one of them converged and one of them diverged。

Let's see a couple other examples just to really lock this in In this example， my C N。

 that constant sequence is now one over n factoria。 So now。

 if I do my ratio of the A plus1 over the A N， I can have a much messier expression First。

 the A M plus1 turn on the top and the A N on the bottom。If I bring the bottom up。

 then I get the following x minus2 to the n plus1 over an x minus2 to the n。

 and then also this n factorial over n plus 1 factorial now。😡，The X minus2 part does the same thing。

 it just cancels on your left with just a single copy of x minus2。

 but let's think about the factorials。N plus one factorial is like n plus1 times n times n-1 times n -2 all the way down。

 It's kind of like n plus 1 times n factorial。So almost all the terms in the factorial cancel except the n plus one term by itself。

 And so what do I get， I get this absolute value of x -2 over the n plus 1。 Now。

 it doesn't matter what x you put in here。 You can put an x equal to a billion。

 The N will eventually drag it down and the limit goes to infinity。 So this limit is always 0。

 So what the ratio test says is because 0 is less than 1。

 that this converges for every single value of x。 And so we say our series converges for all values of x。

 And another way to think about this is that the radius of convergence is infinite。

 The interval from minus infinity to infinity。Third and final example here。 Now。

 I'm going to take that n factorial。 I'm going to move it up to the top It's n factorial times the x -2 to the n。

 Again， I'm going to go and write down my ratio test。

 I'll plug in the n plus one term and the n term。Again。

 I get a lot of cancelling in my n plus one factorial over n factorial， Almost all of that cancels。

 except the n plus one on the top。 So what are I left with， n plus 1 times x-2。 Now， this is。

 in general， going to blow up。 That n term is going off to infinity。

 and it onlenummerators doesn get very large。 very large that is unless x is 2。

 In which case it's n plus 1 times 0， which is always going to be 0。

 So this converges only in that one case of x equal to 0， we say it is a radius of 0。😊，Now。

 these three examples give us three different cases， three different possibilities。 And， in fact。

 for a power series， these are the only possibilities。 It could diverge everywhere。

 except for the x equal to a， the center of your series。It could converge everywhere。

 That's a possibility to， or it could do what it did in the first example where there was a radius of convergence。

 we saw R equal to 1， where if the x minus a in its absolute values was less than the radius it converged if it was more than it。

 it diverg。 And if it was equal to it， then you had to go and plug in the values and adjudicate what what happened in that final French case。

So if you have a power series， one of those three possibilities will occur and you apply the ratio test to try to decide which case are you in。
