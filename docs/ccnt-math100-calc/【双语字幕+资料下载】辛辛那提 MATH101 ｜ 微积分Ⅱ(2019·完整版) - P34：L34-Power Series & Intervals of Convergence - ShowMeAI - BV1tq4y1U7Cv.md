# P34ï¼šL34-Power Series & Intervals of Convergence - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

I'm going begin this video as I have so many other videos on series with the geometric series that all important geometric seriesã€‚

 But this time I'm doing a slight shift to my notationã€‚ It's not the sum of R to the power of nã€‚

 the ratio Rã€‚'s the sum of x to the power N where I'm using x instead of Rã€‚

 Now there's a reason for thisã€‚ Wellï¼Œ it's symbolically just a transformationã€‚

 it's just the same geometric series you know and loveã€‚ but now when I use xã€‚

 I'm thinking that this is really a function of xã€‚ you give me an x in between -1 and1ã€‚

 and I can tell you what the function that is the series is going to spit outã€‚

 it's going spit out1 over 1 minus xã€‚ If you give me an xã€‚

 which is outside of-1 to1 Its just not definedã€‚ So this is a function with a fixed domainã€‚

 the domain between -1 and1ã€‚ So let me take that ideaã€‚

 and let's extend even further to something that we call power seriesã€‚ So a power seriesã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

like a geometric series in a couple different waysï¼Œ instead of x to the nã€‚

 I'm going to have x minus a to the nï¼Œ that's not so very different it's just sort of a shiftã€‚

But I also multiply it not by one every time or by a constant A every timeã€‚

 but by an entire other sequence C Nï¼Œ C N could be one over n or n factorial or who knowsã€‚

 So power series is when you have a variable X raised to power of n may be shifted by the Aã€‚

 and then multiplied by a sequence of constants like one over n or one over n squared or whatever you likeã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ the point is this power series is a function that if you put in different values of xã€‚

 you may get convergenceï¼Œ you get a value out of itã€‚

 Or it may divergge in which case the function is not defined for that value of xã€‚ But either wayã€‚

 if's a function of x with some domain that we want to figure outã€‚So for instanceã€‚

 let's make this concrete by considering a specific exampleã€‚In this exampleï¼Œ the C Nã€‚

 that constant sequence is the sequence 1 over Nã€‚ And then I have an x minus2 to the power of nã€‚ Nowã€‚

 depending on what the x isï¼Œ this may converge or it may divergeã€‚ It depends on that value of xã€‚

 So how can we decide whether this diverges or convergesã€‚ But we have the ratio testã€‚

 this ratio of an plus1 over anï¼Œ and you put the absolute valueã€‚

 take the limit n goes to an afffinityï¼Œ we can do that and will tell us when this convergesã€‚

 And when it doesn'tï¼Œ what values of x make this converge to what values of x make it divergeã€‚

 so let's plug this inã€‚ if I plug that into my ratio on the top I have the anã€‚

 What I put an n plus 1 everywhereã€‚ So x -2 to the n plus1 over n plus 1ã€‚

 And then I divide out just by the Aã€‚ I have a quotient of quotientã€‚

 So I'll bring the bottom one up and what this is just going give me is the limit of an x-2 to the n plus 1 over x 2 to theã€‚

And then multiplied by an n over an n plus1ï¼Œ that's what I get when I bring it upã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNowã€‚

 for the yellowï¼Œ the n over the n plus1ï¼Œ as n gets very largeã€‚

 that is just going to go to the value of oneã€‚Then for the x minus2 portion because it's x minus 2 to the n plus 1 and then x minus2 to the nã€‚

 most of those cancelï¼Œ and I'm just left with a single copy of this x minus2 multiplied by the oneã€‚

So simplifying a little bitï¼Œ I have my limit of my ratios is equal to the absolute value of x minus2ã€‚

 and I'll remind you that what the ratio test told us is it gave us conditions for when that ratio was going to imply that the series converged absolutely or whether it divrged or whether it was inconclusiveã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo if this ratio is less than oneï¼Œ that's when it's going to co converge and if the ratio is equal to oneã€‚

 well it might still convergeï¼Œ but we'll have to do more workã€‚

 we don't yet know for us from the ratio testã€‚So let's do thisã€‚ We know that our ratio goes to x -2ã€‚

 So if it convergesï¼Œ that means it's going to be x -2 is less than1ã€‚

 This is an inequality with an absolute valueã€‚ It has a center of2ã€‚ It has a radius of oneã€‚

 So it's all points that are one away from that center of 2ã€‚

 which is to say that the ratio test is telling usã€‚

 It converges If we are on the interval from one up to 3ã€‚Nowã€‚

 that is when the ratio test guaranteed it convergedã€‚

 but it might converge for even more values of x than that because there's also the inconclusive caseã€‚

 So how do we deal with thatï¼Ÿ What happens when the absolute value of x minus-2 is not just less than1 but equal to1ã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ it's possible that it also converges there if it's greater than one ratio test says for sure it's going to divergeã€‚

 So let's go back to our original seriesï¼Œ And we already know what converges on the1 up to3ã€‚

 we want to see if we can do better than thatã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNoã€‚When absolute value of x -2 is equal to 1ã€‚

 this occurs at two different timesã€‚ If x is equal to 3ï¼Œ the one endpointï¼Œ or if x is equal to 1ã€‚

 the other endpointï¼Œ either of those are going to take the absolute value and make them equal to 1ã€‚

 So let's probably just plug in them inã€‚ So if I plug inï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ x equal to1ã€‚ Wellã€‚

 what do I getï¼Œ it's -1 to the n over nã€‚That's a series we've seen beforeã€‚

 That's an alternating seriesã€‚ This is a series where you've got the minus-1 to the n multiplied by a decreasing positive sequence with limit0ã€‚

 this one over nã€‚ So this converges by the alternating series testã€‚

 So indeed it's not just less than one here and our domain where it converges less than or equal to1 what the other side of thisã€‚

 Well if I plug an x equal to 33 minus2 is11 to the n is just always oneã€‚

 So this is the sum of1 over nï¼Œ which is a P test is the harmonic seriesã€‚

 this divergs So on the one end point it converge and the other it divergedã€‚ So final answerã€‚

 what do we have our interval of convergence is the one less than or equal to the x all the way up to the3 and other pieces of terminology I throw in the mix here is that I will say that the radius of convergence as one and that the center of it is2ã€‚

 So I think of this one up to three is center at2 and then you can go off from the value of one on either sideã€‚

 So one up to3ã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd I've checked my endpoints and one of them converged and one of them divergedã€‚

Let's see a couple other examples just to really lock this in In this exampleï¼Œ my C Nã€‚

 that constant sequence is now one over n factoriaã€‚ So nowã€‚

 if I do my ratio of the A plus1 over the A Nï¼Œ I can have a much messier expression Firstã€‚

 the A M plus1 turn on the top and the A N on the bottomã€‚If I bring the bottom upã€‚

 then I get the following x minus2 to the n plus1 over an x minus2 to the nã€‚

 and then also this n factorial over n plus 1 factorial nowã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe X minus2 part does the same thingã€‚

 it just cancels on your left with just a single copy of x minus2ã€‚

 but let's think about the factorialsã€‚N plus one factorial is like n plus1 times n times n-1 times n -2 all the way downã€‚

 It's kind of like n plus 1 times n factorialã€‚So almost all the terms in the factorial cancel except the n plus one term by itselfã€‚

 And so what do I getï¼Œ I get this absolute value of x -2 over the n plus 1ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 it doesn't matter what x you put in hereã€‚ You can put an x equal to a billionã€‚

 The N will eventually drag it down and the limit goes to infinityã€‚ So this limit is always 0ã€‚

 So what the ratio test says is because 0 is less than 1ã€‚

 that this converges for every single value of xã€‚ And so we say our series converges for all values of xã€‚

 And another way to think about this is that the radius of convergence is infiniteã€‚

 The interval from minus infinity to infinityã€‚Third and final example hereã€‚ Nowã€‚

 I'm going to take that n factorialã€‚ I'm going to move it up to the top It's n factorial times the x -2 to the nã€‚

 Againï¼Œ I'm going to go and write down my ratio testã€‚

 I'll plug in the n plus one term and the n termã€‚Againã€‚

 I get a lot of cancelling in my n plus one factorial over n factorialï¼Œ Almost all of that cancelsã€‚

 except the n plus one on the topã€‚ So what are I left withï¼Œ n plus 1 times x-2ã€‚ Nowï¼Œ this isã€‚

 in generalï¼Œ going to blow upã€‚ That n term is going off to infinityã€‚

 and it onlenummerators doesn get very largeã€‚ very large that is unless x is 2ã€‚

 In which case it's n plus 1 times 0ï¼Œ which is always going to be 0ã€‚

 So this converges only in that one case of x equal to 0ï¼Œ we say it is a radius of 0ã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNowã€‚

 these three examples give us three different casesï¼Œ three different possibilitiesã€‚ Andï¼Œ in factã€‚

 for a power seriesï¼Œ these are the only possibilitiesã€‚ It could diverge everywhereã€‚

 except for the x equal to aï¼Œ the center of your seriesã€‚It could converge everywhereã€‚

 That's a possibility toï¼Œ or it could do what it did in the first example where there was a radius of convergenceã€‚

 we saw R equal to 1ï¼Œ where if the x minus a in its absolute values was less than the radius it converged if it was more than itã€‚

 it divergã€‚ And if it was equal to itï¼Œ then you had to go and plug in the values and adjudicate what what happened in that final French caseã€‚

So if you have a power seriesï¼Œ one of those three possibilities will occur and you apply the ratio test to try to decide which case are you inã€‚
