# P13ï¼šL13- Example - When is a Piecewise Function Continuous - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ I want to investigate whether I can make this particular piecewise function continuous everywhereã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ I have a little bit of freedomã€‚ noticeice that there's a C inside of thereã€‚

 So the hope is that by manipulating the Cï¼Œ I can make it continuous everywhereã€‚ Firstã€‚

 I want to note thisã€‚ If I look at this function here or this function individuallyã€‚

 Like if this applied for all values of xã€‚ either of those are just polynomialsã€‚

 ones a quadratic ones a linearã€‚ and polynomials are continuous absolutely everywhereã€‚

 There's no division by 0ï¼Œ there's no infinite spikesï¼Œ there's no oscillatory behaviorã€‚

 these are continuous everywhereã€‚ So the only possibilityã€‚

 the only spot where there could be a problem was this value of x equal to1ã€‚

 That's where it might be that the limit from the leftã€‚And the limit from the rightã€‚

 and the function value might be differentã€‚ Okayï¼Œ so let's match themã€‚ Our goal is thisã€‚

 I want to say that the limit as x goes to the interesting spotã€‚ The one as x goes to one fromã€‚

 let's do the left first of F of xã€‚What I'm hoping is that this is going to be the same thing as the limit as x goes to1 now from the right of my function F of xã€‚

 so I need that to be the case if I have any hope for it to be continuous and indeed my third condition is that I want it to equal to F of1ã€‚

 that one's going to come more or less for freeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ now let's do the one from the leftã€‚

 Now from the left is this top one up hereï¼Œ X values less than oneã€‚ So in other wordsã€‚

 this is the same thing as the limitã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAs x goes to one from the left of Cã€‚X squared plus oneã€‚

 and this one over here is just going to be equal to the limitã€‚

As x goes to one now from the right of 2 x minus cã€‚

And the f of1 is just going to be plugging in hereï¼Œ this is going to be equal to 2 minus Cã€‚

So these are the three different things that I need to be equal okay well how do I do these limitsã€‚

 both of these limits over here are easy in the sense that these are polynomials so they're continuous so to computer limit I just plug it in so in this case if I plug in one for the value of x so this is equal to 2 minus C the same value as the function value as we would have expected and then over here I'm going to plug in one and I'm going to get c plus1ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo this gives me an equationï¼Œ it tells me that I want c plus1 to equal2 minus Cã€‚

 so let's do that we're going to have C plus1ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒTo be equal to to minus c and then if I do a little bit of manipulation on thisã€‚

 okay I'm going to move this C over and this one I'm going to subtract off so I'm going to have a2 C is equal to1 and so finally I have C equal to the value of12ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd indeedï¼Œ when I do thisï¼Œ this value of sQl to hatï¼Œ it fixes the potential discontinuity at oneã€‚

 the limit from the left is equal to limit from the rightï¼Œ so yes indeedã€‚

 this is continuous at one and because the continuous everywhere elseã€‚

 as are polynomials is continuous everywhereã€‚
