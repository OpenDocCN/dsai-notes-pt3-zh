Previously， we've seen something we called trigoometric integrals。

 which are just integrals in a whole bunch of tri terms in them。

 And the basic strategy was that you found some trig identity that allowed you to manipulate a challenging integral into one that was doable with a simple U substitution。

 Now， in this video， we're gonna to be talking about trigonmetric substitution。

 There's some integral， some integral we don't know how to do。

 But we introduce trigonometry via a substitution。 Then we can use all of our different trigonmetric identities to transform into one that we know how to do。

 So this comes up in a whole bunch of natural context。

 one of which is the problem of finding the area of a circle。

 This is the circle given by x squared plus y squared equal to1 is a circle of radius 1 or more precisely a quarter of a circle of radius1。

 Now， we know what the area of a quarter circle is。

 We know the area of a circle is pi are squared if far as one， then the area of a circle is pi。

 And if a quarter circle is just pi divided by4。 because I've chosen a quarter circle。

 I can take this equation， and I can actually。😊，A function of it。 I can solveulfur Y。

 I can take the positive square root， and I can rewrite this as y equal was a square root of 1 minus x squared。

 Now， we know the area of a circle formula。 But where does it come from， How do we derive it。

 One of the big triumphs of calculus is that we can figure out areas underneath curve。

 So if I have this curve here， this y equals square root of 1 minus x squared。

 Then I can figure out the area between 0 and1 of the square root of 1 minus x squared dx。

 And that better be the answer of pi over 4。 So really。

 what I'm trying to do is hey this particular interval。

 And that's something that I'm trying to study Now， how do I solve it。

You might think we could do a U substitution like， oh， I don't know。 It's a square root of blah。

 So what if we make that inside this1 minus x squared are U。

But then our D is going to pick up an X and there's no x outside of the square roots。

 so it just doesn't work out。Well， what else can we do， I going to do a different substitution。

 Just bear with me for a moment of why I'm choosing this。 I'm going to choose a substitution。

 X is s of theta。 Notice that this sort of works in the reverse of how we normally do U substitution。

 normally we take some complicated， messy function of X and set it to be our new variable。

 Now we're taking the X itself and setting it to be some function of a new variable。

 It's sort of backwards for the normal U substitution。 But nonetheless， let's take the substitution。

 and let's just see how it goes。 If this is our x， then R D X is costa theta D theta。

 And if I going to transform the in。 I also have to transform the limits of integration。

 the 0 and the 1。 So if I take the x equal to 0 or the x equal to 1， what theta value do I get out。😊。

Now， there's a technicality here， there's a bit of a problem we have to work through because there's an ambiguity here。

😡，If you think about what the graph of sine of theta is， it's going to look like this。😡。

And if you ask， well， when sine of theta is 0， what theta value is。

 Well sine of theta is 0 at theta equal to 0 pi 2 pi minus pi minus2 pi all sorts of places。

 So there's not just one answer here。 Likewise for the value of one。

 sine of theta is equal to 1 at pi over 2。 but also at minus3 pi over 2 and many other values。

 So how do we resolve the ambiguity。 I have to choose a region of sine of theta and restrict my domain to just that region that I'm going to talk about。

 For instance， let me take this region right here that I've highlighted in green between minus pi over 2 and pi over2。

Notice that in this region， the graph of sine theta。

 it attains all the values between minus and 1 and 1 is in that this region is big enough。

 any possible value that sine theta can ever achieve is achieved by taking a value of theta between minus power 2 and power 2。

But it's also achieved only once。 And that's the key idea。 In mathematics。

 we often call this one to one。 The notion that any value that is attained is only attained exactly once。

 But the idea is that if I restrict my domain to the green to this minus pi over 2 up to pi over 2。

 Then I can adjudiate a questions。 like if x equal to 0， what value is sine of theta。

 and I can adjudicate them uniquely。 So in particular， if x is equal to 0。

 it forces it that theta is equal to 0， that is the only place where sine of theta is equal to 0。

 And likewise for one is going to occur at pi over 2。

 So now that I've done all this sort of technical stuff， I can plug everything in， I've got my x。

 I've got my D X。 And I've got my limits of integration， I plug those in。 And what do I get。😊。

0 to pi over 2， the square root of one minus sine squared theta times cosine of theta d theta。 Now。

 what we've done is we've transformed this integral into one with a lot of trigonometric terms in it。

 And so what am I going to do， I am going to use the methods of trigometric integration that we've seen before。

 One of the things that stands out to me is the one minus sine squared。 because I have an identity。

 I have that pythagan identity that sine squared plus co squared is just one。 And therefore。

 if I take the one minus the sine squared。 that's going to get a co squared and of the square root。

 So I get the integral from 0 to pi 2 of square root of co squared times another cosine of theta。

 Finally， the D theta。 Now， you might be tempted have that square root of a squared just write cosine there tor。

 But you have to be careful about the sine。 because when I take the square root of something squared。

 I lose the plus or the minus。 So I have to adjudicate whether there's positive or negative。

 But thankfully， I have that restriction on my domain。 I know I'm talking about thetas between。😊。

us pi over 2 and pi over 2。 So if I look at what the graph of cosine was between minus pi over2 and pi over2。

 you see how cosine is all positive in that green selection。

 So the square root of co squared it is just going to be cosine that there is no negative sine that needs to come in。

 It's just all positive so I can just replace this and say this is the integral from 0 pi over2 of one cosine。

 that's the square root of the co squared times another cosine of theta and then finally multiplied by the d theta。

Now it's just a trigger micro goal。 we can do the same methods we've done previously。

 It's an even power。 so we'll use that half angle identity。

 We rewrite that as one half of one plus cosine of two theta。

 This is an integral that we're able to do。 And so I can go and integrate that。

 I get theta over2 minus one quarter sine of two theta。 I evaluate between the0 and the pi over2。

 andvo we get pi over four the answer that the area of a circle that pi r square。

 but were doing a quarter circle。 That answer was pi over four at the beginning。

 and indeed we've got pi over4 now。😊，There actually is a bit of a chart for these kind of things。

 When we made that choice that X was sine of theta， How did we do that， Well。

 I just gave it to you in this video。 I didn't explain how in next video。

 I'll talk a little bit more how to anticipate it。 But if you want。

 there is this chart here that tells you what substitution to use and what different situations。

 What the restriction on the domain ought to be and what trig identity you're going to use。 Now。

 I'm put in this chart up here， But I would actually caution away from using it。

 I like to think through it， Anticipating， what tri of identity am I going to use。

 what would be helpful if I have some expression。 What should I try to do。

 Should it be signs cosines tangent or whatever。 And I'll talk a little bit more in the next video about how to make those kind of choices。

 But here is this chart just to get you rolling。😊。
