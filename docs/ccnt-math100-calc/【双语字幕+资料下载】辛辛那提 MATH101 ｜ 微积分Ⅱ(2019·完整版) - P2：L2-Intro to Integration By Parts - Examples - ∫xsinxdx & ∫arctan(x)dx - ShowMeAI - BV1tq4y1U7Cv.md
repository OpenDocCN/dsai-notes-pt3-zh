Yeah。Welcome to the first video for calculus 2。 Every day before class。

 we're going to be watching a video a little bit like this one。

 a video that establishes the foundation， the basic ideas for whatever it is that we're going to be talking about。

 And in this video， we're gonna be talking what integration by parts。

 Let's begin with the product rule。 So what did the product rules said。

 It said if you took the derivative of the product of two functions。

 wasn't just F prime times G prime it was this whole thing， F prime times G plus Fg prime。 Now。

 what I'm going to do is integrate both sides with respect to X。

 And this is gonna to give me my so called integration by parts formula in a second。

 I have to manipulate it。 But the basic idea is that if you integrate the derivative of the product。

 you just get the F times G on the left。 And then on the right hand side。

 I've got an integrated with respect to X。 So I'm going to take this。

 I'm going to rearrange everything。 And the rearrangement has been that the integral of F G prime。😊。

Is equal to F times G minus the interval of Fg pro， just a rearrangement of the previous formula。

This is the integration by parts formula。 It says if you have a product that's written in one way。

 In this case， the integral of F times G prime， you can answer that is taking the product of F times G and a different integral。

 The integral of F prime times G。 So it's sort of a way to take one integral written in as a product and manipulated it into being a different integral that's also written as a product。

By the way， there's another way to write this using U and V notation that's very， very common。

 basically the F and the U are the same， but the G prime Dx is put together into a DV and the F prime Dx is put together into a DU。

 but regardless， this is probably the most common way that integration by parts is written down。😡。

So let's see how we can use this particular formula in an actual example。

 The integral of x cosine of x。 Basically， what I have to do is when I see the x cosine of x。

 I have to say that there is a u in there and that there is a Dv。

 I have to identify these two different parts。 Well， which should it be， Should the X be the U。

 Should the cosine D X be the Dv or should it be the other way around， Well， I think about cosine。

 If I take as derivative or it's integral。 I can keep on doing that as many times as I want。

 It just keeps alternating between ss and cosines with minus signs。

 It doesn't really get any easier or simpler to sort of alternates。😊，But for the X。

 if I take a derivative， the derivative of x goes down to1。

 Where the anti derivative of x is x over 2。 So I want to take the derivative。

 I want to set the x equal to the U。😡，I want to set the cosine of x dx equal to my Dv because then I can take the D U and the x is going to go down to a1 so I've identified them here the U and the Dv and actually what I typically do for myself。

 I find this helpful is to actually go off on the side and write them down and be like U is equal to x and Dv is cosine of x dx。

😡，And then I had to figure out that my D is just equal to， well， Dx if the u is equal to x。

And then if I know that my Dv is the cosine dx， then the V is going to be sine dx because the derivative of sine is cosine。

So I sort of collect this data up here， and then I can go and fire it into the formula。

 So what happens when I do that， I would have the x sine of x。 that's my u times V。

 And then I subtract off the integral of sine of x dx But notice what happened。 Now。

 integral of sine。 I can do that。 I know how to do that。 That's an elementary  one。

 And so I can compute that out。 and I get x sine of x plus cosine of x plus the value of C because this is an indefinite integral。

 Can't forget that plus C。 So in effect， we transform by integration of by parts。

 the integral of x cosine of x which we did not know how to do into the integral of one times sine of x and one times sine of x。

 we did know how to do。 and so we did that integral。😊，Now。

 what we saw previously was the indefinite integral where you do not specify them as integration。

 Now I'm writing down the formula for the definite integral where I have an A and I have the B in my x is going between that。

 and I've chosen to write it down in sort of its fullest form where I'm not using any shorthand I'm using F of x times G prime of X。

 And the big thing to note is that you just evaluate between the A and the B everywhere。

 But in particular， when it comes to that F times G is F times G evaluated s between the A and the B。

 and then the integrals， of course， are evaluated between the A and B as well。

 But you use a different symbology from when its functions being evaluated and whether you're integrating between two different values。

 regardless， this is what happens when you go and write down the definite integral。Okay。

 let's see how this works in a specific example。 This is kind of a tricky example。

 First thing I want to note is we know the derivative of arc tan of x1 over1 plus x squared。

 but we do not know the antid of arc tan of x。 We never saw that back in calculus 1。 how do I do it。

 It's not immediately clear to me。 And it doesn't even look like a product。

 So integration by parts is in some sense undoing the product rule。 Well。

 there's not two different things here。 but there is in disguise。

 This really looks like the function 1 multiplied by the function arc tan of x。 So I can set a U。

 and I can set a Dv。 I'm gonna set my u to be the arctan because I can take the derivative of that。

 I know the derivative of arc tan1 over1 plus x squared。

 And then the Dv is just gonna to be the Dx part。 let me write that down over here just so I haven't written down。

 I've got my U I've got my Dv。 I now need to figure out the other thing。 So my D U as well。

 the derivative a101 over1 plus x squared times the Dx。 and then。😊。

The anti derivative if dv is equal to dx， then V is just equal to the value of x。Okay。

 so we've got that values。 Let's go and plug it into our formula here。

 We are using the definite formula。 Now。 I've got the integral from 0 all the way up to the one。

 And I put it into my Uv minus Vdu format。A couple different complicated things about this first up we had to figure out how to deal with the arc tan portion and then we had to do this integral the integral takes a couple steps as well so let's think about just the arc tan first。

😡，For Arctan， I try to figure out aana 1 and arctan of 0。 for this。

 you need to know special triangles and the special triangle that's relevant here is the so called 1。

1 route 2 triangle。 This says that tangent。😊，Of pi over four is one over one， which is just one。

So if 10 of pi over 4 is one， then arc 10 of one is just pi over 4。

 So this special triangle allows me to evaluate。 arc 10 of1 is just pi over 4。

 And so I can replace out what's going to happen to this left portion。

 It's going to be x equal to one times this pi over 4。 and then 0。 by the way。

 arc 10 of 0 is 0 as well。 Now， I had to figure out the interval。 That's the next portion。

 I have to go and do this thing。 So let me clear up a little bit of space。

 And I'm just going focus just on that。😊，How do I solve this？Now you might recall from calculus 1。

 this is a U substitution problem。 Molly the link to a video that introduces you substitution right there。

 So if you're a little bit shaky with U subs， go and check that out。Now， for this useub。

 I see I have this kind of messy denominator 1 plus x squared。And the derivative of that denominator。

 which would be 2 x， well， there is an x in the numerator， so not talking about the two。

 but I don't have to worry about that so much。But I've got the X。

 So this is going to be just a standard U subpro like you could have had in calculus 1。

 Let's run through it。 I'm setting you to be my denominator here， the one plus I squared。

 My du U is 2 x dx。 I also had to figure out where my 011 are going to transform to if I've transformed with a U substitution。

 my limits of integration come along with them。 So plugging in the value of 0 infr x。

 I get u of 0 is equal to 1 plus 0。Plu in the value of one infrar x， I get one plus  one squared。

 So2。 So indeed， my0 and one transformed to one and 2， plugging all of that into my used subtitution。

 I get the interval from one to2 of one2。Notice that it the D was2 Lex dx， and there's no two there。

 So I have to have this factor of one half。 So one half times D divided by u。

The integral of1 over U may recall is just the natural logarithm of the absolute value of U。

 so it's one half， the natural logarithm， absolute value of u evaluated between1 and two log of1 is0。

 so this is just going to be the value of log of two times that value of a half， one half log 2。😡。

By the way， I can get rid of my absolute value signs when I realized too was a positive number doesn't matter。

Okay， so that was the other piece of information。 So where were we。

 That was this integral we were trying to compute there。

 We'd already figured out the arc tan abortion。 and it was the power before。

 Now I plugging this little value that we have。 And that's it。 That is our answer。 Now。

 I really liked this example because while it had many different moving parts。

 parts that you should pause the video and refer back to and make sure make sense in your head。

 there was the fact that it was a definite integral。

 It was sort of a weird choice of this integration by parts because there was only one function。

 We had to evaluate this complicated use of integral。 And we had to evaluate arc tan values。

 There was a lot of mess to it。 But it allowed us to do an integral that we had no idea how to do by calculus one methods。

 All right， that's it for this video， and I will see you all soon。😊。
