In this video， we're going to take a polar curve， one that relates the R and theta in polar coordinates。

 For example， r is1 plus cosine of theta。 And we're going to try to just sketch it。

 We want to have a reliable way to be able to do that。 So how can I do this。 Well。

 one sort of brute force crude method is to just go and plot a whole bunch of points。 So for example。

 I have computed for a wide range of theta is what R of that theta is going to be。 So， for example。

 theta is equal to 0。 You plug that into one plus cosine of0 and you get the value of two。

Some of the other points down on the list might seem a little bit hard to compute like actually。

 what is cosine of5 pi over 4。 So let me just take one moment describe how I do that。

 My typical method is to use the unit circle。 So I've drawn the unit circle of length1。

 And what I know is that if I put a point on that circle。

 and I consider it horizontal and vertical components。 Well。

 this forms a triangle and because it's a unit circle， it's hypotenuseesis  one。

Then the horizontal and vertical components of this triangle are going to be cosine of theta and then sine in theta So for instance。

 if I plug in pi over4 enforcement it the hypoten uses one that's going to mean that the height and width of this thing which have to be the same because pi over4 makes an an isoscease triangle。

 then this is going to be one over root2 and1 over root2 for the sine in the cosine。😡。

So then to figure out well， what is cosine of pi over4， well。

 it's just going to be this value of one over root 2 divided by1 then one plus cosine so one plus one over root 2 okay that's fine And we talked about that in the past。

 but what about3 pi over4 So3 pi over4 is over here and for3 pi over4。

 you get basically the exact same triangle with one slight change is that the cosine the horizontal component is now negative in Pythagas doesn't matter。

 the horizontal squared plus the vertical squared has to be equal to1。

 but if I think about just what the cosine is now the cosine is going to be minus1 over root2 and then1 plus cosine of the theta is going to be1 minus one over root2。

So the point here is that when I think about the unit circle， I can take the pi over four。

 which I know well。And its corresponding thing in the second coordinate when theta is equal to3 pi over 4。

 and therefore， the inner angle of that triangle is a g pi over 4。 It's the same ratio。

 It's just that the s may change。And then I think you can pause the video and see whether you can get the5 pi over four and the7 pi over four yourself。

But I'm going move on to try to plot this list of points。 So how do I do that。 Now。

 there's actually two ways to plot this list of points， One slightly more effective than the other。

 The sort of maybe older way that you might consider would be， look。

 you know how to do plotting of points and Cartesian。

 So you can take all of these theta R values that are in polar。

 You could convert all of them to Cartesian。 and then you can try to go and plot the Cartesian thing。

 I would not recommend that， but I'm just pointing out you could do it。

 what I'm going to do is I'm gonna to plot them as points in polar coordinates。

 So our method is going to be kind of like a connect the dots type thing。

 I'm going show you how to plot all the dots。 All the green points here from this table。

 And then I'm going to show you how to think about connecting the dots to get the entire shape。

 Allright， So let's go point by points。 So the first one I'm going to focus in on is theta equal to0 and r is equal to 2。

 So this is going to be this particular points。 this20 here。 R is equal to 2 theta is equal to 0。

 the way I think about that is I am going to draw a half line that。

Starts at the origin and goes out at an angle of theta which is just right along the positive x axis so saying that theta is equal to zero tells me I'm somewhere along that line and because r is equal to  two it means I am two units along the line and so that's how I get to this 20。

😡，Okay， let's do a more interesting one。 Let's do the next one。

 So in the next one I'm talking about pi over 4。 So instead of having theta equal to 0。

 I now have theta equal to pi over 4。 and somewhere along that line。

 my point is going to lie in particular lies when R is1 plus one over root 2。

 Now root 2 is a little bit bigger than one。 So one over root 2 is a little bit less than one。😡。

So one plus one over root2 was a little bit less than two。

 so if you notice we started at a length of two， but when we rotated it up to pi over4。

 we got a little bit shorter in our Rs。Lets keep on going。 Next up is theta is equal to pi over 2。

 So pi over 2 is now straight up， and I'm going an even smaller radius up there。

 I'm only going one up。 All right， next one， I'm going to three pi over 4， which lives over here。

 So I'm somewhere along that line of three pi over4 And in particular。

 the length is this one minus1 of root2。 a smaller radius again。

 And then absolutely final one here is going to be pi is equal to 0。

 So now I am lined up on the negative x axis theta is equal to pi。 And it tells me my radius is 0。

 But if you have a radius of 0 along this half line， means you're just right at the origin。Okay。

 I'm going to let you pause and try to come up with the other four points yourself to see whether you can visualize where those go all right。

Now I'm going to do something a bit different。My goal is to recon those dots in a moment。

 and I'm going to get there。 but what I'm going to plot for you is r equal to one plus cosine of theta。

 not as a polar curve。 This is not the polar curve， R equal to one plus cos theta。😡。

This is what I would get if I just pretended that I was doing this in Cartesian。

 if I gave you y is equal to1 plus cosine of x， that's what you did。

 If you treated this as a Cartesian thing， so it looks just like cosine。

 but instead of going between1 and minus1， it goes between 2 and zero because of the shift up by plus1。

😡，Then what I'm going to do on this sort of Cartesian version of the polar curve。

 which is not my final answer。 So I'm going to plug in all of my green dots， all of my points。

 those my regular space values of theta， I think were pi over 4， pi over 2，3 pi over 4 and so on。

 And I'm also going to color codeda。 There's going to be a yellow region that goes between0 and pi over 2。

 a red region between pi over 2 and pi and so on。😡。

Okay so now let's stop thinking about this as Cartesian， we're going to do what we want to do。

 which is to treat it as a polar curve。 So we had the dots that we plugged in and figured out earlier now we're going to connect the dots and we're to talk about how to do that。

 Let's think about the yellow region， the region between zero and pi over 2 So this is where I start between theta equal to zero that is and I rotate up to theta equal to pi over 2 and I want to talk about how our changes as I go between these different theta values。

😡，Well， if I look at the plot of it in its Cartesian version that as you do this rotation。

 you start from zero and you go up to pi over2， what's happening is that the radius starts at a length of two and then decreases and decreases so I can't make my arm shorter。

 but instead of being a radius of two it's now half of that it's only a radius of1。😡。

So let me see how that works when I fill in the dots here。 Watch how it goes。

 I'm going to start with theta， I'm going to increase increase to up to pi over 2 and my radius as I did that rotation got smaller and smaller and smaller。

 it started with a radius of 2， I was down at theta equal to  zero and it ended up with a radius of1 when I was up at theta equal to pi over 2。

😡，Alright， let's continue carrying on connecting the dots。

 So now we're going to go into the red region between pi over2 and pi。

 so that is from straight vertical down all the way to pi on the negative x axis。In this case。

 the radius starts at one and by the time it's rotated all the way down to theta equal to pi。

 the radius is all the way at zero。Okay， so let's do that。 Let's continue our rotation as we plot。

 So we're going to plug it in here and the red region it starts at a radius of 1。

 and it ends up at a radius of 0 right when you got that theta equal to pi value。😡，Okay， next region。

 starting with theta equal to pi， and I'm going down to theta equal to three pi over  two。

 I'm in the pink in the pink。 Well， at pi， my radius is0。 if I look at my Cartesian plot。

And then at3 pi over 2， my R， my height of the Cartesian or the radius in my polar has increased back up to 1。

 So as I go from here down to here， it starts at the origin R equal to 0 and goes out until such time as the radius is equal to one when it' all the way straight down at3 pi over 2。

😡，Fal region。 Now we're going to go into the blue region from3 pi over2 up to pi。

 So now we're starting down here and we're grading all the way back up to the positive axis again when we get to the de gulu2 pi。

 This is going from one down here all the way up to 2。

 And so we can fill it in and we get this nice little shape that we call a cardiooid。

 If you imagine rotating this 90 degrees。 So it was facing up。 It kind of looks like a heart。

 So we call it a cardiooid。
