Today， we're to talk about the final two tests that we're going to use in calculus 2 to analyze whether our series converge or diverge。

 And to do this， I want to begin by recalling the geometric series。

 which was really how we began our introduction into series。 And for the geometric series。

 what we had was a series with a fixed ratio R。 was some of a times that ratio R to the power of M -1。

 And whether the geometric series converged or divrgge depended on that value of R when the absolute value of R was less than1。

 but not only converge， but we knew what it converge to。

 and what the absolute value of R was greater than or equal to1， it diverge。 Now。

 I'm going to call the terms in the sequence a sub n as I normally do。

 but just to distinguish it the blue A is a constant that multiplies out the a sub n is the entire thing。

 And what I want to do is I want to investigate the ratio of successive terms in a geometric series。

 Indeed， I want to consider A plus1。😊，Dided by A N。 Now。

 the whole point of a geometric series is that this is just going be that ratio R。

 indeed in the numerator here， if I plug in n plus one n our formula， just get A R to the N。

 and then in the denominator， don't change it at all， A R to the M-1。

 then the A's cancel and most of the R's cancel and I'm just left with R。

 So the point I'm trying to hammer home here is that for a geometric series。

 it's really defined by this fixed ratio R that the ratio of an plus1 to A is just R。

 Now we're going use this as a model for our ratio test。 And for our root test。

 we're going say what if a series is not a geometric series。

 But in the limit as your n gets really large， it starts to look a lot like a geometric series。

 then maybe behaves in a similar way。 So indeed， what we're gonna have is this the ratio test considers the same ratio of the A plus1 to the A I did before。

 And if that ratio is less than1。 So in the limit is n goes to infinity， it becomes。A number L。

 which is less than one than it converges just like it did in the geometric series。 Likewise。

 if I consider the limit of the ratios and its number， which is greater than one or diverges。

 then we're going to say that the series is going to diverge。 And then in the final case。

 this is where it differs a little bit from the geometric series in the final cases。

 what happens if this is equal to one， in which case the test is useless。 It's inconclusive。

 It doesn't tell you one way or the other。 Now， the way I think about the ratio test is that in the limit is then goes to infinity。

 it starts a approaching a geometric series。 So if that ratio is firmly less than one。

 then much like for a geometric series， it converges。 if that ratio is firmly bigger than one。

 then like a geometric series， it diverges。 but if it's exactly equal to one that inconclusive case。

 then the fact that this is only true in the limit means I don't know whether it's accumulating a little bit bigger than a geometric series a little bit。

than a geometric series， I don't know what it's going to do when it goes to exactly one。

 So let's see how this works in an example。 I've got the sum of2 to the n over n factorial。

 So to apply the ratio test， let me consider the ratio of the A plus ones over the ANs。

 And what I do for the AN plus1 as I take that two to the n over n factorial。 And I just plug it in。

 So it's2 to the n plus1 over n plus1 factorial。 And then in the denominator it's a two to the n over n factor。

 I don't change that one。😡，Well， I'm going to go and collect things a little bit。

 so I can rewrite this as put all the twos in one spot and all the factorials in the other。

 So it's a two to the m plus1 over a2 to the n。 and then an n factorial over an n plus1 factorial。

 I've done the business when you have a quotient of quots。 you can bring it up like this。 Now。

 how do I figure out what this is going do。 the twos are not so bad。2 to the m plus1 over2 to the n。

 It cancels and you just left with a single copy of two。 But what about the factorial terms。

 recall that say5 factorial is five times 4 times3 times 2 times1。

 It's multipied all the integers down to one。😡，So if I have n factorial。

 it's like n times n -1 times n -2 times n-3 dot dot dot， always subtracting one。 That is。

 I can replace this with the yellow part。 The two doesn't change。

 But the factorials are expanded as this n， this n-1 n -2 all the way down through to1。

N plus one factorial expands as n plus1 times n times n1 n-2 dot dot dot 3 to1。

 And most of those are going to cancel it。 In fact。

 the only thing in the blue that doesn't cancel is that one n plus1 in the denominator。

 So what do we get2 over one， the yellows that happens pretty simply。

 And then one over n plus1 from the factorial portion。 And indeed。

 now we have an n in the denominator， we're taking load as n goes to infinity。 this is equal to 0。

0 is the number less than1。 And so by the ratio test， we're going say that this thing convergeence。

 So the way I think about this is that in the limit as n goes to infinity。

 the ratios between the terms get closer and closer just to multiply and by 0。

 And that's something that if it was a geometric series， and it was0 to the n。

 you'd certainly say was going converget。 So2 does it here。Now。

 let's go and see two examples where it's the inconclusive case。

 The sum of1 over n and 1 over n squared。 These are both P series。

 so we can apply the p tested to it。 The top one is p equal to 1 so that diverges in the bottom one is p equal to2。

 which converges。 But if I consider the ratio。 Okay for the top one。

 the ratio of the A plus1 over the As， I plug it in。

 So1 over n plus1 over1 over n do a little bit of algebra to bring it up， and I get n over n plus1。

 and this is a limit I can do highest power on the top highest power in the bottom n over n。

 So it just becomes1 Likewise， for the bottom one， if I consider this quotient of A plus1 over an。

 Well，1 over n plus1 squared about to by1 over n squared again， will bring it up。

 And what do we get n squared over n plus1 squared。

 Now I want to do a little bit of work and the denominator here。

 I've got this thing I should probably expand it out。

 So I will do that that gives me n squared plus2 m plus1。

 and then highest power of the top is n square。😊，Highest power in the bottom is n squared。 So again。

 its limit is just one。 So in this case， the ratio test is useless。

 It doesn't tell me either of these things。 Both of the limits just appear to be one。

 but in the first case， it diverges in the second， it converges。 So indeed。

 this ratio test is inclusive。 when the ratio in the limit is only one。😡，Allright。

 next thing we're going to do is very similar to the ratio test， but it is called the root test。

 Notice that it looks very similar， except I am no longer considering the ratio of success of turns the AM plus1 divided by the A。

The rest of it's the same， you look at instead at the eighth root of AN。

 and it's either a number less than one in which case it converges。

 it's a number greater than one in which case it diverggees or it's a number equal to one in which case the test fails and it's inclusive。

😡，Why are we looking at the n root of AN and how do we get this back to the geometric series， Well。

 let's see an example like this one。 So in this series， I have bh to the power of N。😡。

It sort of looks like a geometric series， right， like a geometric series was an r to the power of N。

 except instead of a fixed number R， I have this weird quotient thing。

So if this weird quotient thing in the limit becomes a value。

 then I can think of that as being analogous to the geometric series。

 If the quotient is going to become a value of L， which is either less than one bigger than one or equal to1。

 I can apply these conditions from my root test。 So really。

 what I'm interested in is considering the limit of the inside of my brackets。

 the inside of this thing to the power of n。 if that thing goes to a fixed ratio R。

 then I can do the sort of analogy by geometric series and claim this root test。

 So how do I actually do that， Well， I am going to take the n root。😡。

Of all of this stuff to the power of N。 and root is like to the power of one over n。

 So I can rewrite this as the stuff in brackets to n over n。

 which is just the same thing as just stuff just in brackets itself。

 And that's really what I want to get my hands on， that's what I want to consider the limit of。

 And if I take this limit， indeed， it goes to this ratio of one half， which is less than one。

 So it converges via the root test。 So the big idea for both the ratio and the root test。

 is that the thing we understand well， as the geometric series when there is a fixed ratio R on the terms。

 But depending on how it presents。 I can get things that approximate a fixed R。

 at least in the limit is n goes to infinity， it becomes this fixed R。

 And sometimes we're going to use a ratio of the two terms explicitly to get our hands at that thing we want to be a fixed ratio。

 And sometimes we take the n root of things。 But either way。

 we're looking to get something that has a common ratio in limit as N goes to infinity。😊。
