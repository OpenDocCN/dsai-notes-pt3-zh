# P36ï¼šL36- The MEAN Value Theorem is Actually Very Nice - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to talk about a very interesting theorem called the mean value theemã€‚

 a theorem that we're going to see is actually very intuitiveã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

I want to imagine I've got some function hereï¼Œ and it's a function where I've got some Aã€‚

 F of A and some Bï¼Œ F of Bï¼Œ I've specified two endpoints on itã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_4.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_5.png)

And then what I'm going to first look at is what is the CA line between the point A F of a and the point Bã€‚

 F of Bï¼Œ it's going to look like thatï¼Œ that's a CA lineã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_8.png)

Now I wanted to think about tangent linesï¼Œ there's all sorts of tangent lines is a tangent line hereã€‚

 tangent line thereï¼Œ tangent line thereï¼Œ tangent line thereã€‚

 there's all sorts of tangent lines to this curveï¼Œ but one of those tangent lines is going to be the one that has the exact s slope as the secant line Indeed looks like it sort of hits right around here where the slope of the tangent line at that point and the slope of the secant line are exactly the same thingã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_10.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_11.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_12.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_13.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_14.png)

So in effectï¼Œ the claim of the mean value theorem is that for nice functionsã€‚

 and we'll define what we mean by nice functions in a momentï¼Œ but for nice functionsã€‚

 there is always such a tangent lineï¼Œ there's somewhere on the curve where the tangent line and the secant line are the sameã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_16.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_17.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_18.png)

So I will begin my theorem by saying the slope of the secretant line on this interval AB that we're consideringã€‚

 rememberï¼Œ a secant line needs an A and a B in order to be defined is defined between two pointsã€‚

 so the secondant line on AB is the same thing as the slope of the tangent lineã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_20.png)

Of courseï¼Œ there are many tangent linesï¼Œ it depends on which point we're consideringã€‚

 So what we're really saying is that somewhere there is a value C down here and it's the tangent line at that point Cã€‚

 So I'm saying the little second line is the slope of the tangent line at some point C and my C here is inside of my domainã€‚

 but notice a small tweakã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_22.png)

The big domain is AB with closed bracketsï¼Œ including those endpointsã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe point Cï¼Œ thoughã€‚

 is on the inside in the round bracketsã€‚So we're going to have to just pay attention to that little detail for nowã€‚

Okayï¼Œ so that's the sort of idea qualitativelyï¼Œ but I want to come up with precise formulas for itã€‚

I know what the slope of the tangent line is that one's easyã€‚

 that's the definition of the derivative it was the slope of the tangent lightã€‚So indeedã€‚

 the slope of the tangentline hereï¼Œ it can be just replaced with the derivative at seaã€‚

And then what about the slope of the seaMã€‚ Wellï¼Œ I have an ability to do a rise over a run here is an F of B minus M of Aã€‚

 that's going to my rise my change over hereã€‚ And then I can divide it up by my run between my A and my Bã€‚

 So I replace this by claiming thatã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_24.png)

The slope of the seaant lineï¼Œ the rise over the run hereã€‚

 It's just the same thing as the slope of the tangent lineï¼Œ the derivative at seaã€‚Nowã€‚

 is this true for all functionsã€‚ Wellï¼Œ noï¼Œ I said it was true for nice functionsã€‚

 so now let's be more preciseã€‚ What do I mean by niceã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_26.png)

Wellï¼Œ my precise claim is going to be the followingã€‚ I am going to demand that my functionã€‚

 my F of x is differentiable on the open interval with round brackets A Bã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_28.png)

And continue on the closed interval with square brackets where I'm including the A and the Bã€‚

This is the hypothesis or the conditions of my theorem when I have thatã€‚

 then I'm going to have this existence of a Cï¼Œ this existence of a C where the sub of the sea outline line and the so of the tangent see are the same and then collectively we're going to call this thing the mean value theoremã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNowï¼Œ I'd previously given you a nice example of a function where it sort of was graphically transparent to usã€‚

 that it was true that we could sort of point at and findï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ about thereã€‚

 the slope the tangent line is the same thing as the sub the secret lineã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_30.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_31.png)

But why do I need these conditions Why couldn't I relax the conditions a little bit So what I wanted you to think about is why must I have both of theseã€‚

 why must I have this claim of differentiability on AB with open brackets and this claim continuity on AB with closed bracketsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_33.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_34.png)

Let's do the differentiable point firstã€‚ I want you to think about this function here Now this function is not differentiable on AB because it's got a corner point and we know that all corner points are not going to be differentiableã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_36.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_37.png)

But I can still put a Seaant line on rightï¼Œ there's that Seaant line as it ever wasã€‚

 it connects this point A F of A down here and Bï¼Œ F of B up thereã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_39.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_40.png)

So is there some value of C on this curve where the tangent line is equal to Cï¼Œ I think noã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_42.png)

For all of these points hereï¼Œ the tangent line is just the same thing as this lion very different over here it a negative valueã€‚

 it's not even remotely the same as the slope of the tangent line and then that interesting point right thereã€‚

 it's not differentiableï¼Œ there's not even a definition of a tangent lineã€‚

 so this is a situation where f is not differentiable on AB and therefore the mean value theorem just does not apply and it's good that it does not apply because it wouldn't work in this example which shows why we need that condition of differentiabilityã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_44.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_45.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_46.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_47.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_48.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_49.png)

Okayï¼Œ what about the coninnuity claimï¼ŸSo now I'm going to consider if F not continuous on the closed intervalã€‚

 I'm going to go right to the end and look at my function that I've given hereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_51.png)

This is the function that comes along and then right at the very end pointï¼Œ I'm including the Bã€‚

 that's where it's breaking its continuity pointï¼Œ right at the endpointã€‚

 it's the round circle which in case it's not the value thereï¼Œ that's the valueã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_53.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_54.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_55.png)

So if I come up with the secant line to this thingï¼Œ because the actual value of F ofB is right hereã€‚

 the Seaant line has to go through that as wellï¼Œ but of course all of the tangent lines are going to be down here on my graphã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_57.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_58.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_59.png)

So if it is not continuous at the entire closed interval ABã€‚

 I could demonstrate an example where the mean value of theorem failsã€‚

 unless I need both of my two conditionsã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_61.png)

Im going to give you one more exampleï¼Œ in factï¼Œ it's a special case of the mean value theoremã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_63.png)

This is what happens when I've got some function but has unique property that the F of A right here is the same height as the F of Bã€‚

 so then if I try to think about what the Seaant line is going to beã€‚

 well it's going to be completely horizontalï¼Œ its slope is going to have no rise because F of a is going to be equal f of Bã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_65.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_66.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_67.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_68.png)

And indeedï¼Œ we can see that what's going to be that slope the tangent line where it has to be is horizontalã€‚

 it occurs right here above some value Cï¼Œ and it goes in this particular example up to this maximumã€‚



![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_70.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_71.png)

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_72.png)

Now this is just a special case of the mini value theoremã€‚

 the slope of the Seaant line is equal to the slope of the tangent lineã€‚

 but it's an important enough of a special case that we're going to pull it out and give it its own nameã€‚

 it's going to be called rolls theoremã€‚

![](img/6d3fe0b67a2326b103ed66162a98dce6_74.png)

You'll notice this got the same conditionsï¼Œ the differentiability on the open interval ABã€‚

 the continuity on the square interval ABï¼Œ but now we're saying that we're assuming that the f of a equals f of b and we deduce that the derivative at C is0 for some value this C inside of the open interval A to Bã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNowï¼Œ one of the reasons why role theorem and mean value theorem are pulled out is that we often in mathematicsã€‚

 we're trying to prove thingsï¼Œ we start with a simpler case and then generalize and the canonical way to prove the mean value theorem is to first prove role theoremã€‚

 the specialï¼Œ easier caseï¼Œ and then prove the mean value theorem deduced from role theoremã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So even though I'm not going to prove the mean value theorem for you in this particular videoã€‚

 I still want to identify the important historical special case of Rule theoremã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
