We looked at this graphicallyÔºå but now I want to study this f of x numerically and we know that one is the interesting spot„ÄÇ

 so let's study what happens as we get reallyÔºå really„ÄÇ

 really close to the value of x equal to1 so I'm going to make a table of values here I just got a whole bunch of different x values and then I've plotted out what the F of x values are because as x plus1 it's easier to do I just add one„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_3.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_4.png)

And then the x values I'm takingÔºå notice are 0„ÄÇ90„ÄÇ99Ôºå999 and so on„ÄÇ

 these are numbers getting closer and closer and closer to the value of one„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_6.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_7.png)

And then if I think about what's happening to f of xÔºå wellÔºå 1„ÄÇ9Ôºå 1„ÄÇ99Ôºå 1„ÄÇ999„ÄÇ

 and so it is getting closer and closer to the value of two„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_9.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_10.png)

So this scenario we're going to use a bunch of mathematicalmatic notation is going to be a bit fancy„ÄÇ

 we say this big bizarre symbol and what we mean by it in English is that the limit of this function f of x„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_12.png)

As my X values get really close to one„ÄÇNotice that there's this one with a superscript of minus„ÄÇ

 that means from the leftÔºå as in all these values are just a little bit to the left of the value of one„ÄÇ

 that's what this minus sign here in the exponent means all from the left„ÄÇSo his values get really„ÄÇ

 really close up to oneÔºå but all from the leftÔºü

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_14.png)

The F of x valuesÔºå they get reallyÔºå reallyÔºå really close to two„ÄÇ

And so we say the limit f of x as x goes to one from the left is equal to 2„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_16.png)

So that was what happened if I was looking to the left of my point1„ÄÇ

But what happens if we instead look to the right So in other words I want to take now x values are all just a little bit bigger than my value of one and I denote this by this one„ÄÇ

 but with a positive in the superscript this is now talking about going off to the right and I read this as the limit of my function as x gets really„ÄÇ

 really close to one but from the right of it as being equal to two„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_18.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_19.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_20.png)

So we have a notion of the limit from the left and a limit from the right and I can talk about a notion of the limit from both sides and in other words I can have to have two different tables here„ÄÇ

 I've got the one table where I've got all the values a little bit to the left I've got this other table a little bit to the right„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_22.png)

And I don't put any superscript at all in my fancy symbol down here„ÄÇ

 we just say the limit as x gets close to one without any qualification„ÄÇ

 and in either case it's going to be equal to two we read it limit of f of x as x approaches1 is2„ÄÇ

So now let's investigate the same thing but graphically so here's our f of x and what I wanted to do is I want to look as we get close to one here and basically the idea is this is if I get really„ÄÇ

 really close to one from either side either from the left or from the right that what I'm going to have is that my function values they all get closer to what's the height here„ÄÇ

 it's this value of 2 so as I sort of get closer and closer and closer and closer to my point„ÄÇ

 maybe point01 from that point 001„ÄÇ0001 as I get closer and closer to this point„ÄÇ

 the height of the function is getting closer to this value of2 and so we say that the limit is x goess to one of f of x is2„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_25.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_26.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_27.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_28.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_29.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_30.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_31.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_32.png)

Exact same story as beforeÔºå but now I've changed it from my f of x to my G of x and all of my tables have changed not at all„ÄÇ

 There's no change from my f of x to my G of x and anything I've written here Y well the only difference between F and G was what happened at one the G was not to find that one but the F was but notice what's happened with my tables„ÄÇ

 I'm putting points in that are very close to oneÔºå but I'm never putting in one exactly„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

And so in all of these points really close to one G and F for the same thingÔºå I get this result„ÄÇ

 the Gs look like they're getting close to two from the left„ÄÇ

 they look like they're getting close to two from the right„ÄÇ

 and so I will again repeat that the limit as that goes to one of my G of x is going to be this value of2„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåAnd then graphicallyÔºå it's this storyÔºå rememberÔºå G of X was the one where I had this hole here„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_34.png)

But if I'm getting reallyÔºå really closeÔºå if I'm trying to get closer and closer and closer and closer to this particular point„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_36.png)

WellÔºå it's true that there's no actual point thereÔºå but that the limit is still two„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_38.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_39.png)

The limit doesn't care what happens at the pointÔºå it only cares about what's happening as you get really close to it and so as you get really„ÄÇ

 reallyÔºå really close to this pointÔºå it sure looks like it's going to the value of two and so we say that it's going to be limit to even though the function value does not exist at this particular point„ÄÇ

 a limit still does„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_41.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_42.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_43.png)

So in many waysÔºå a limit is going to be an idea that's going to sort of fix problems we might have in functions like this„ÄÇ

 we talk about what the behavior looks like around a point„ÄÇ

 even if at the point it's very poorly behaved„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_45.png)

OkayÔºå we've got one more function to compare„ÄÇ That was our function„ÄÇ H of x here„ÄÇ Again„ÄÇ

 H of x is exactly the same as F and exactly the same of G everywhere„ÄÇ

 except for the one point where x is equal to1„ÄÇ But these tables don't have x equal to1 so they look the same„ÄÇ

 they look like they're getting close to two and we say the limit of H of x as x approaches one is2„ÄÇ

üò°ÔºåAnd then graphically we have a similar scenarioÔºå let's imagine what happens if I'm going to be taking my x values as I get closer and closer and closer and closer and closer to this value right here„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_47.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_48.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_49.png)

Now it's true H itself is this weird extra point that we have sticking up there„ÄÇ

 but that doesn't matter to me„ÄÇ the limit ist an idea of what happens around a point„ÄÇ

 not at the particular pointÔºå so around this point is getting really close to that value of two„ÄÇ

 even though at the point it's some other value„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_51.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_52.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_53.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_54.png)

So I think what we've shown is that the limit is x goess to one of my F of x„ÄÇ

 limit as x goess to one of my G of x and limit as x goess to one of my H of x„ÄÇ

 those three different functions that while different„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_56.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_57.png)

The limits of them were all going to be two at this interesting point of x equal to 1„ÄÇAll right„ÄÇ

 so let's try to actually come up with a notion precisely of a limit„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_59.png)

So I'm going to define it like this„ÄÇThis broad collection of symbols is what I'm defining here„ÄÇ

 I'm trying to define the entire set of symbol all at once„ÄÇ

 you can think of it as sort of one single entity„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_61.png)

And what I am defining whenever I write down a weird set of expressions like this is the following„ÄÇ

I can make my functionÔºå my F of X„ÄÇ

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_63.png)

As close as I might like to this limiting valueÔºå toÔºå in the previous caseÔºå that is„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_65.png)

I can make my f of x as close to L as I might possibly wish„ÄÇ

 just by taking the X values and making them as close as they have to be to the value of a close but not equal we don't care what happens at the point„ÄÇ

 we just want reallyÔºå really really close ones so the idea is if I want my limit to be within some tiny number of the actual value„ÄÇ

 I have to choose x values presumably within some tiny number of the x equal to a„ÄÇ



![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_67.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_68.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_69.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_70.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_71.png)

![](img/551905b9ef77636cd95bcda25c296289_72.png)

Now I should be clear that this definition that we have here is a little bit of an intuitive one„ÄÇ

 I haven't used a lot of precision that in this particular class we're not actually going to go into the formal definition of the limit using epsilons and deltas„ÄÇ

 if you want you can look at chapterpt 2„ÄÇ4 of Stewart that goes into that detail and gives a sort of mathematically more rigorous definition than the bit more intuitive one that I've written down here„ÄÇ
