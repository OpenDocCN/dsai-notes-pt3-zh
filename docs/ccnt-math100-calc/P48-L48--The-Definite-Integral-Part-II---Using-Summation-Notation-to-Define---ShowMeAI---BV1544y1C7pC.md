# P48ï¼šL48- The Definite Integral Part II - Using Summation Notation to Define - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Now I wanted to dive right back into integrationï¼Œ but I got to use a little bit of notation firstã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_1.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_2.png)

This notation is called summation notationï¼Œ this big capital sigma here is denoted for sum and it reads the sum from one up to nã€‚

 a sum from the bottom thing up to the n thing of whatever it is in this case I've given a generic symbol X I and the way this works is it's x1 plus x2 plus x3 plus x4 plus x5ã€‚

 so on and so on until you hit whatever the top isï¼Œ so x1 all the way down to Xnã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_4.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_5.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_6.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_7.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_8.png)

As in summation notation is just a shorthandï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ if n is 100ã€‚

 I don't want to write out 100 termsï¼Œ so I can use this summation notation to make it look a little bit simplerã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_10.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_11.png)

I can also give a specific formula for what the XI wasï¼Œ here's a really simple oneã€‚

 I could say to sum from one to nï¼Œ but where my X I is just Xi equals to Iã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_13.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_14.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_15.png)

In that caseï¼Œ if I plug an i equal to1ï¼Œ I'm going to get1ï¼Œ if I plug an I equal to twoï¼Œ I get twoã€‚

 i equal to 3ï¼Œ I get3ï¼Œ plus one plus 2 plus 3 all the way down to nã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_17.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_18.png)

Now I can also play around with the start and with the end and what goes in hereã€‚

 so here's one more funky exampleï¼Œ this one I'm starting at three and going to sevenã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_20.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_21.png)

And that the thing that I put in is Xi equal to i squaredï¼Œ so what do I getã€‚

 I'm starting here at threeï¼Œ so I get three squared plus four squared plus5 squared plus7 squared and so on down the lineã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_23.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_24.png)

So this is summation notationã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_26.png)

All rightï¼Œ so now let's return to the original area problem that we've seen beforeã€‚

 our goal is to figure out what is the area underneath this curve x squaredã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_28.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_29.png)

And the technique that we had seen was that we were going to use an rectangle approximation here I've given the right rectangle approximation adding up all the way alongã€‚

 and we previously computed that the areaï¼Œ I sum up these different rectangles and I got this value 0ã€‚

44ã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_31.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_32.png)

What I would like to do now is try to represent what's going on here using summation notation and the way I'm going to do that is followsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒDown at the bottomï¼Œ we have these widthï¼Œ 0ã€‚2 everywhere here that we've written in our sum that was going to represent the widthsã€‚

And I'm going to put this together as the sum of five thingsï¼Œ so I want a sum from one to fiveã€‚

 and so the way I write it is the sum from one to fiveã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOf X I squaredï¼Œ that's like the 0ã€‚2 squaredã€‚

 the 0ã€‚4 squaredï¼Œ the 0ã€‚6 squaredã€‚ So X I squaredã€‚Multiplied by these widthï¼Œ the 0ã€‚2ã€‚ In other wordsã€‚

 this area is like the sum of the area of rectanglesï¼Œ where each rectangle has a heightã€‚

 the X squared and has a widthï¼Œ the 0ã€‚2ã€‚ So this really just means the sum of rectanglesã€‚

 the sums of the areas of rectangle to have a height and have a widthã€‚Nowï¼Œ what initially is the XIï¼Ÿ

In this caseã€‚The X squaredï¼Œ if we look at what we've written out hereï¼Œ 0ã€‚2 squaredã€‚

 and that corresponded to if I go down to 0ã€‚2 up hereï¼Œ the 0ã€‚2 by my functionã€‚

 which squares it is going to go to 0ã€‚2 squaredã€‚So the x1 is going to be 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ the x2 is 0ã€‚

4 all the way down to the x5 being 1ã€‚0ï¼Œ those are my sort of five locationsã€‚

I wanted to write this bit more genericallyã€‚ One thing that I could do is I could try to write out X I and notice that they're all multiples of 0ã€‚

21 times 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ2 times 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ3 times ã€‚2ã€‚ X 4 is 4 times02ã€‚ So I can say that generally X I is 0ã€‚

2 times whatever I isã€‚ X 5ï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ is 5 times 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ which is oneã€‚

So what I have managed to do is my original just sort of summation we wrote downã€‚

 I've given specific labels to what the x1ï¼Œ X2ï¼Œ x3 and generically Xi is going to beã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And so finallyï¼Œ taking this formulaï¼Œ this X I is a 0ã€‚2 I and putting it into my area formulaã€‚

 I can clean this all up by saying the area is the sum from1 to5 of 0ã€‚2 I squared times the final 0ã€‚

2 times these widthsã€‚So I haven't really done anything conceptually different hereã€‚

This is indeed going to be the same 0ã€‚44 that we computed in the previous video what you accomplished in this video is to find a notal efficiency to write down the sum of these areasã€‚

And it might not even seem that beneficial when our numbers are going from me from one to fiveã€‚

 but if I was asking one to a millionï¼Œ it'd be a lot more beneficial if we could write it with sum nation notation than if we had to go and list all the different values and indeedã€‚

 this notation is going to be very important for us as we try to compute these values not is an approximation but to figure out exactly what the area is because right now I'm only figuring out the area of the rectangles and it's going to be in the limit as this five becomes reallyã€‚

 really large that we're going to be interested in what the actual area isã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo the various stepsã€‚

 if my goal is to figure out the area under the curve between two points A and B are first of allã€‚

 I want to divide my interval into M subinters of with Dxã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_34.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_35.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_36.png)

In the example that we've seenï¼Œ we had a width of oneã€‚

 and then we divided that into five different subintersï¼Œ each of width point2ã€‚

 So that's our first stepã€‚ We divided it upã€‚ Then we're going to choose a point X I inside of each subinterã€‚

 And we've seen there's a couple possibilitiesã€‚ You could choose the left end pointã€‚

 You could choose the right end pointã€‚ If you want toï¼Œ you could choose the midpointã€‚

 you could choose the maximum value of the functionï¼Œ the minimum value of the functionã€‚

 There's actually quite a lot of different possibilitiesã€‚

 But I usually just like to choose the right endpointã€‚ But nonethelessã€‚

 you just choose some point in each of these different intervalsã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_38.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_39.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_40.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_41.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_42.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_43.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_44.png)

And then we're going to form our rectangle approximationï¼Œ and it's a sumã€‚

 it's a sum of little rectanglesï¼Œ and those little rectangles have these widths Dxã€‚

 that's what we've already determinedï¼Œ and they have these heightsã€‚

 the function value at whatever points you've chosenã€‚

 usually the function value evaluated at say the right end pointã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_46.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_47.png)

So you get this formula for the rectangle approximationã€‚

 and then what our goal is is to take this formula for the rectangle approximation and take the limit of it as n goes to infinityã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_49.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_50.png)

And so that's going to be my final stepï¼Œ my setting of my area is this limit as n goes to infinity of those rectangle approximationsã€‚

 or in other wordsï¼Œ limit n goes to infinity of this formula we've seenã€‚

 the sum of rectangles height of f of Xi and width of deelta Xã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_52.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_53.png)

Nowã€‚This conceptï¼Œ this idea of taking an area and writing it as a limit of a rectangle approximation is reallyã€‚

 really important to the development of calculusã€‚ And it's so important that we're going to give it a fancy new set of symbolsã€‚

 So now I'm going to define for you a new collection of symbols referred to as the definite integralã€‚

 I'm going to say thatã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_55.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_56.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_57.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_58.png)

The so-called definite integral between the values A and B notice that this is the curve between the two points A and B so this is the integral from A up to B of my functionã€‚

 I write this weird little Dx symbol is just what I have hereã€‚

 the limit n goes to an infinity of the sum of these rectangles where they've got heights f of Xi and widths delta Xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_60.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_61.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_62.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_63.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_64.png)

And really what I'm doing is I'm defining this entire collection of symbols holisticallyã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_66.png)

The Dx here is related to the deelta Xï¼Œ although we use a little bit of a different symbolã€‚

 we think of deelta x philosophically as a small but still nonzero intervalï¼Œ something like 0ã€‚2ã€‚

 we think of the Dx sort of infiniteally smallï¼Œ there's a small change in the philosophy of this that we'll delve into more in the futureã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_68.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_69.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_70.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_71.png)

So we can give a little bit of a change in variablesï¼Œ deelta x versus Dxã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_73.png)

The function remains the sameï¼Œ and the other sort of honor yield might note is thatã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_75.png)

For the definite integralï¼Œ this symbolï¼Œ I put the A in the Bï¼Œ But over hereã€‚

 I don't explicitly put the A in the B thereï¼Œ but it's thereã€‚

 When we take our interval and divide it up into the sub intervalters of widthï¼Œ Delta Xã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 the A and B is needed to determine where the X Is are to determine the width of the deelta X and so forthã€‚

 So the A's and B's are built into this formulaã€‚ They're just not written down explicitlyã€‚



![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_77.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_78.png)

![](img/c4b7a6eab9f1e52960470c4d5c1f1263_81.png)

There're sort of big picture takeaways that you can think of of an integral sign is an integral sign is basically just a sumã€‚

 It's a sumï¼Œ but a sum where you're not taking these really discrete separate points and you're adding up all these different rectangles in the limit as then goes to infinity they're getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and you're taking a sort of infinite sumã€‚

 that's what the symbol denotesã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
