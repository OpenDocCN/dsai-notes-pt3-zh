Let us compute the limit as S goes to infinity of arc tangent of x„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_2.png)

So there's a couple points here that might cause a little bit of problems„ÄÇ

 first of all hold on X goes to infinityÔºå we haven't seen that before„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_4.png)

And then also our tangent of xÔºå what exactly is thatÔºü



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_6.png)

So let's look at our tangent of x first and then before I do arctan I'll remind you of what the graph just of tangent was„ÄÇ

 so here's the graph of tangent it goes up and it keeps on having this sort of periodic behavior where at plus pi over 2 or minus pi over2 that what you get are these asymptopes„ÄÇ

 these vertical asytoes and they're important enough that maybe I'll even sort of label it that this is going to be pi divided by 2 over there and at this one what's around there are going to be minus pi divided by 2„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_9.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_10.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_11.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_12.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_13.png)

So tangent is a periodic functionÔºå and this is its graphÔºå but I'm not asking about tangent„ÄÇ

 I asked about arc tangent„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_15.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_16.png)

So the way these arc trigoometric terms work is that they're an inverse in the same way that E to the x and LN of x„ÄÇ

 the natural log of xÔºå that those are inverse functions are the same way that x and1 over x are inverse functions„ÄÇ

 tangent and arc tangent are inverse functions„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_18.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_19.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_20.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_21.png)

So if you have the graph of a functionÔºå and you want to graph its inverse function„ÄÇ

 you alternate the role of Y and x„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_23.png)

So this is what the graph of arc tangent looks like„ÄÇ we've got this graph of tangent„ÄÇ

 We have the line y equals x that flows through here„ÄÇ

 and I want you to imagine that I flip this picture around the line y equals x„ÄÇ

 And so then what I get is this graph here„ÄÇ That is my graph of arc tangent of x„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_25.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_26.png)

Sometimes I write it out in words arc10 of xÔºå sometimes you write10 with an exponent of minus1 of x„ÄÇ

 don't be confusedÔºå this does not mean tangent of x all to the power of minus1„ÄÇ

 which would be read1 over tangent of xÔºå it's not that it's not an exponent of minus1„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_28.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_29.png)

The -1 means an inverse function„ÄÇ I think it's a bit confusing so that's why I usually just write out arc tangent events„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_31.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_32.png)

But either wayÔºå you should see this symmetry hereÔºå we've got this line y equal to x that comes through here„ÄÇ

 and arc tangent flips over the tangent„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_34.png)

The other defining property that we have here is that for an inverse function„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

If you compose them in either wayÔºå So 10 of a 10 or arc 10 of 10Ôºå either way you compose them„ÄÇ

 what you get out of it is just the identity function„ÄÇ NowÔºå I should say one quick caveat„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_36.png)

That this only works for what we call this one branch of tangent in truth tangent is this periodic function„ÄÇ

 here's a little bit of another branchÔºå here's a little bit of branch„ÄÇ

 but there's sort of this one major branch between minus pi over 2 and pi over 2 and our tangent is defined to be the inverse just for that branch so this formula only works in the particular domain minus pi over 2 up to pi over2„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_38.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_39.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_40.png)

For the purposesÔºå just of computing what the limit wasÔºå all I need is this graph„ÄÇ

 so that's all I've left behind here„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_42.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_43.png)

This is some graph and as X goes largeÔºå that's what it means going to infinity bigger and bigger a million billion trillion carries on„ÄÇ

 it's going off and off far to the rightÔºå but it' sort of flattens out on me Yes„ÄÇ

 it's going off to the right but it doesn't carry on up to infinity„ÄÇ

 it doesn't sort of oscillate or to anything weird what it looks like is it just flattens out and becomes close to this one value„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_45.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_46.png)

And in factÔºå we can talk about what that one value wasÔºå as you might recall„ÄÇ

 if I go back and I look at tangentÔºå that at the value of pi over two here„ÄÇ

 that tangent was going to have a spike towards infinity at this value of pi over two„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_48.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_49.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_50.png)

So then for the inverse functionÔºå when we're sending it off to infinity„ÄÇ

 it's getting close to a height of pi over 2Ôºå so I'm going to claim that the limit is x goes to infinity of our tangent of x is equal to pi divided out by 2 that that is what we are now going to call a horizontal asymptote„ÄÇ

 or I will usually abbreve it as horizontal asymptote and H A„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_52.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_53.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_54.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_55.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_56.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_57.png)

I' I can ask the exact same problem here for the limited I go to now minus infinity„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_59.png)

So that's me coming alongÔºå coming alongÔºå coming along„ÄÇ

 we have another one of these horizontal lasin toes and if I go back and look at what the graph was„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_61.png)

As it went down to minus infinityÔºå we knew that that occurred at pi over 2„ÄÇ

 That is the zero of the denominator in sine x over cosine of x„ÄÇ

 So this value here is minus pi over 2„ÄÇ that's where it goes to minus infinity„ÄÇ

 So in the inverse function in our tangentÔºå as it goes to minus infinity„ÄÇ

 it flattens out to a horizontal la andeÔºå the value of minus„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_63.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_64.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_65.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_66.png)

Pi divided by two„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_68.png)

I really like this particular functionÔºå arc tangent„ÄÇ

 we're going to use it a whole bunch in our course„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_70.png)

Let's do the same trickÔºå but now another familiar functionÔºå E to VXÔºå so here's the graph of EDVX„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_72.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_73.png)

And we've got the two different questionsÔºå what happens to go to positive infinity„ÄÇ

 what happens to go to minus infinityÔºå I do minus infinity first actually because is sure looks like is just flating right out„ÄÇ

 getting smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller closer and closer and closer to zero and so I'm going to say that this indeed is just equal to the value of zero I'm going to say that the limit is x goes to minus infinity has a horizontal layte at the height of y equal to zero„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_75.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_76.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_77.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_78.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_79.png)

But what about what happens is x goes to positive phm going over here„ÄÇ

 but exponential it increases foreverÔºå it gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_81.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_82.png)

So this is not like this example where it got arbitrarily close to zero if I wanted to do within 0„ÄÇ

1 or 0„ÄÇ01 or 0„ÄÇ001Ôºå I could just go far enough to the left„ÄÇ



![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_84.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_85.png)

But that's not true on the right„ÄÇ It ever gets close to one value„ÄÇ It just always gets bigger„ÄÇ

 It hits a million than it hits a billion than it hits a trillion after some time„ÄÇ

 It just keeps on going forever„ÄÇ So we're gonna to say the limit x goes to infinity of E to the x is just going to be equal to infinity„ÄÇ

 It is unbounded„ÄÇ

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_87.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_88.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_89.png)

![](img/55010ec7a76cc6b2930b03878591286a_90.png)

And so for functions like thisÔºå you have this sort of interesting behavior„ÄÇ

 there is one horizontal asytote and one where as the x goeses to infinityÔºå it diverges to infinity„ÄÇ
