# P22ï¼šL22-Harmonic Series _ It diverges, but insanely slowly! - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to talk about the harmonic seriesã€‚

 which after the geometric series is one of the most important series to understandã€‚

 This is the series adding up one over nã€‚ So1 plus a half plus a third plus a fourth and so onã€‚

 converge or does it divergeã€‚ Nowï¼Œ I'll recall that to figure out convergence of a seriesã€‚

 we look to the partial sums and take the limit of the partial sums as n goes to infinityã€‚

 So in this caseï¼Œ if I try to figure out what say S 2 isã€‚ Wellã€‚

 this is adding out the first two terms 1 plus a halfã€‚ Nowï¼Œ I'm going to be a little bit trickyã€‚

 I'm not going to investigate S 3ï¼Œ I'm going to skip right to S4ï¼Œ which is2 squaredã€‚

 And if I investigate S 4 is1 and a half and a third and a quarterã€‚

 But notice how I've highlighted the one third in the one quarterã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWhatever this isã€‚

 this is going to be bigger than if I replace the one third with just another one quarter isn' and it's bigger than one plus a half plus a quarter plus a quarterã€‚

 I'm doing this little inequality hereã€‚ I'll show you why in a secondã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWellï¼Œ if this is the caseã€‚

 a quarter and a quarter is a halfã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo I have a one plus one half and then another half that is to say I have one plus two halfã€‚

 so it's certainly bigger than thatã€‚Okayï¼Œ let me skip againï¼Œ and I'm going to go to S sub2 cubedã€‚

 that is S sub 8ï¼Œ and I have to write it down a little bit smallerã€‚

 So I'm going one plus a half plus a third plus a fourth plus a fifth plus a6 plus a seventh plus an eighthã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd I'm going to do a similar kind of trickã€‚ The one third I'm going to say is indeed going to be bigger than the one fourthã€‚

 So I'll do thatã€‚ I'll replace the one third with the one fourthã€‚

 But I'm also going to replace the oneï¼Œ fifththï¼Œ the1ï¼Œ6 and the1ï¼Œ7 with  oneï¼Œ8sã€‚

 So I have four different oneï¼Œ8sã€‚ and I have this inequality as a resultã€‚

 And then in much the same way that the quarter plus the quarter added up to a half4 copies of an8 also adds up to one/ halfã€‚

 So I have one plus a half plus a half plus a halfï¼Œ which is three halfã€‚ So indeedã€‚

 we have one plus 32sã€‚So notice the pattern hereã€‚ When I take S sub2 to the power of nã€‚

 it appears to be bigger than1 plus n divided by 2ã€‚

 So I haven't worried about the rest of the partial sequencesã€‚ And I have an inequality hereã€‚

 whatever this S sub n is is actually bigger than this thingã€‚ So if this divergesã€‚

 If this one plus n over 2 divergesï¼Œ which it doesã€‚

 Then that is going to mean that the entire thing divergesã€‚ Soï¼Œ so let's take that limitã€‚

 Let's put and limit signs in front of this S sub to nã€‚

 which is the same thing as being bigger than the limit n goes to infinity of this one plus n over 2ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe right hand side diverges to infinityã€‚ And so the limit of the partial sumsã€‚

 or at least these restricted ones divergeã€‚ But even if just some of the partial sums diverge as long as it regularly goes off towards infinityã€‚

 then the whole thing divergesã€‚ It can't get close to a finite number like one every once in a whileã€‚

 It gets as large as you might wishã€‚ So what do we say the harmonic series divergesã€‚Nowã€‚

 the harmmonic series is actually reallyï¼Œ really coolã€‚

 not because it diverges as it is an example of one that divergesã€‚

 but because it diverges incredibly slowlyã€‚ Soï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 suppose you wanted to get to the value of2ï¼Œ you wanted to add up some number of these terms from the horn series you want to get to 2ã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ if you take  one and a half and a third and a quarter adding those four terms gets you over2ã€‚

 So you only need four terms to get to bigger than2ã€‚

 But how many terms do you think you might need to add up to sayï¼Œ I don't knowã€‚

 what's not so large 100 admittedlyï¼Œ it's going to take a lot of termsã€‚

 you start adding things like 1100th 1101ï¼Œ1ï¼Œ102ï¼Œ These are really small numbersã€‚ So to add up to 100ã€‚

 you're going to need a lotã€‚ But how many do you really needï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 it turns out if you wanted to add up to 100ï¼Œ you need more than 10 to the power of 43 to be able to add up to 100ã€‚

 So that's only to get to 100 to get to much larger numbers like 10ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

or a million or a billion and indeed this goes on to infinity it divergesã€‚

 you're going to need absolutely enormous number of terms so this is a fun example of mathematics of a series that does divertã€‚

 you keep on adding these terms it's not going converge to a value like one the way the geometric series did that we saw before with R equal to half it is gonna diverge to infinity can be as large as you may please but to be as large as you may pleaseã€‚

 even just 100 you will need this enormous number 10 to the 43 terms to be able to do so which is absolutely crazyã€‚
