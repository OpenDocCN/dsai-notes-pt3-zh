In this video， we're gonna to be talking about trigoometric integrals。

 which are just integrals that have a whole bunch of trigoometric expressions on the sine squared。

 co cubed， whatever else。 Now， the basic strategy is to take all of the different trigoometric identities that are out there in the world and use some of them in special way to try to take these trigoometric integrals that we don't know how to do that are hard and transform them via identities into ones that we can do by just a simple use attution。

 for example。 Now， before we do this， let me just review my favorite way to understand trigonometry。

 the unit circle。 The basic idea is this。 you have a unit circle， one of radius length1。

 That's what we mean by unit。 I put the point on the circle that's sitting here the 0。10。

 And then I rotate counterclockwise。😊，And as my point goes around this circle， at any point。

 it creates a triangle that is a right triangle with angle theta。Because this is a unit circle。

 the hypoten use has length1。 and what that means is if I take something like sine of theta。

 which is opposite over hypotenus， when the hypotenus is one。

 then sine of theta is just the opposite。 So for this vertical scripts。

 the opposite I can put sine theta and for the adjacent the horizontal base I can write cosine of theta。

 This is in some sense， the definition of sine of theta and cos of theta。

 this is how I can graph sine of theta and cosine of theta， and more importantly。

 I can get a whole bunch of different identities from the unit circle。 For instance。

 there is the pythagorean identity。 Pythagor applies to any right triangle of which this is just one。

 and it says that the height squared plus the base squared is the hypotenus squared。

 So in this context， sine squared plus cos squared is1。 and then from this identity。

 I can get two more of these so-called Pythagorean identities。

 The second one comes from dividing everything by cosine of squared sine squared over cos squared is tan squared cos squared over cos squared is1。

😊，And one divided by co squared is c can squared。 and likewise。

 the third comes from dividing everything by sine squared。 Okay so now let's go back to integration。

 So the first one I'm gonna do is actually when I don't need an identity for1 I can do by calculus1 methods。

 I've got the integral of sine squared cos of x dx because it looks like something squared。

 I'm gonna to make that something to U my U is sine of x then my du is cos of x dx plugging this in。

 I get the integral of u squared du I want to pause and note that that du was really important we had a cosine right like we needed the cosine to get the du regardless。

 I can integrate that， I get u cubed over3 plus c as an indefinite integral and then when I substitute back in for x sine cubed of x over3 plus C。

Pretty straightforward。 Just a U substitution。 But if I make it just a tiny bit more complicated sine squared cos cubed notice that I cannot do that anymore。

 If I tried to make u equal to sine of x， then my du is cos of x， but I don't just have cos of x D X。

 I have co cubed to x Dx。 So this doesn't work， if I try to make my U。

 the cosine of x that my D is the minus sine of x dx。 but I don't have just a single copy of sine。

 I have two copies of sine again， this does not work。 So what can I do， Well。

 I'm going to employ that identity， I'm going to employ the pythagororean identity that sine squared plus co squared is1。

 And if I do this， well， I could take the sine squared and turn them into some co squared terms。

 but then everything would be coss， there'd be no du U if I setAT my U is cos。 However。

 if I go and take that cos cubed， and I rewrite that co cubed as a co squared times a cos。😡。

I could take two of the cosines and manipulate them by the identity。

 That is I'd have the initial sine squared。 Then the next co squared return into one minus sine squared。

 and then I have one more cos of x dx。 Then I can clean it up even more sine squared minus sine to the fourth of x。

 all multiplied by cos of x dx。 And this is why it is so useful to have that cos of x。

 because now I can set my u equal sine。 I can set my du to be cos of x dx。 And in that case。

 I just get u squared minus u to the fourth du。 Now this is just a polynomial it's going to be u cubed over 3 minus u to the fifth over 5 plus c。

 And when I substitute back in taking that u equal to sine of x。

 I get sine cube of x divided by 3 minus sine to the fifth of x divided by5 plus C。

 So in other words， this is basically just do a pythagorean identity in a clever way so that I can do my u substitution。

 But what if I confuse it again。😊，is no sine squared co squared。

 I can't do the pythagorean identities anymore。 If I take two copies of sine squared。

 I can make them two copies of cosine squared， but then it' would be all coss。

 I can take those two copies of cos and turn them into sine by Pythagorean identity。

 but then it would be all signs。 there would be no possibility of a D。 So what can I do Well。

 thankfully there are more identities。 The next one's I' gonna to show me where the socalled half angle identities。

 They take sine squared or co squared and they make them one half one minus sine 2 x in the sine squared case or one half1 plus the co 2 x in the co squared case。

So in this case， where I have sine squared times cos squared and I'm gonna apply the half angle identity for both of those。

 I get the one half one minus co 2 x and the one half1 plus co2 x dx。

 okay now two things we multiply So I have to go and expand them out and of my expansion， Well。

 let me look first at the red arrows。 the red arrows cancel this one half co2 x and minus one half co2 x they cancel but the blue arrows remain。

 so what do I get one quarter， minus one quarter cos squared2 x dx Now this is pretty good However。

 the cos squared of2 x term I still cannot integrate that。 I don't have a good method for co squared。

 but I could take that half angle identity and I could apply it not to cos squared to x cos squared of 2 x So what do I get。

 Well the one quarter comes out the front。 then minus the one quarter again。

 and I get a one half one plus cosine not of2 x now of4 x because I would apply it to co squared of 2 x。

So I have to go and multiply that by two， so four x。Now， this is an interval I know how to do。

 so I can get x over 4 minus x over 8 minus116 sine of 4 x plus that value C。 So in this example。

 we had to use very different trigotometric identities。

 but it still gave us an answer that was tractable that was doable after a little bit of work。 Now。

 if I give you something like sine to the n co to the M for various n and M。

 can I have a strategy for the entire class of problems。 Well。

 if either the n or the M happened to be odd， I could do what we did in the Pythagorean example。

 And when we had co cubed， we took two powers away of the co squared and we left one co behind to become my D。

 I could do the same thing it was co of the fifth Co to the7 Co to the9 and likewise。

 if it was the sine term that was the odd，1 I could have done it there as well。

 But if they are both even as in that last example， I have to use the half angle identity first。😊。

Final point， sine and cosine work well together。 We have these identities that relate them。

 but T and secant work well together and co secant and co tangangent work well together。 There's。

 for example， Pythagorean identities for each of these three pairs。😡。

Now the big idea here is not that there is one strategy。

 one method for every type of imig that has trig terms in it， In fact。

 there's so many different identities out there in so many weird special cases that it would be very long and hard to try to even attempt to exhaust all the possibilities。

 but if we have a little bit of foresight if we think about it if we anticipate what is going to be ourU。

 what is going to be our DU， what trig identities can I use to get me there。

 then we can articulate a strategy that lets us solve a huge number of these trigonometric intervals。

😡。
