# P8ï¼šL8- Limits of Oscillating Functions and the Squeeze Theorem - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Let's investigate this somewhat funky limitã€‚

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_1.png)

What we're doing is we're taking the limit is our x goes to zero from the rightã€‚

 that's what the plus deotes of sine of1 over xã€‚

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_4.png)

So I want to figure out what does the graph of sine of1 over x actually look likeï¼Ÿ



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_6.png)

Because so let me think first about what the sine of x looks like just a self sine of x you might recall goes up and down and up and down something like thisã€‚

 and it obeys this pattern foreverï¼Œ it keeps going up and down and up and down and up and downã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_8.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_9.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_10.png)

So if I look at sine of1 over x nowï¼Œ well sine of1 over x and I'm taking numbers that are really close to zeroã€‚

 so one over a number really close to zero is a really large number like for exampleï¼Œ if I take 0ã€‚

01 then  one over 0ã€‚01 is 100 so as these numbers x get closer and closer and closer to0ã€‚

 what's inside of the sign gets really really really bigã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_12.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_13.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_14.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_15.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_16.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_17.png)

But if I think about what happens as s gets reallyï¼Œ really big sine of x itselfã€‚

 not a sine of1 over xï¼Œ as sine of x goes really bigï¼Œ wellã€‚

 it just keeps going up and down and up and down and up and down between minus1 and one So I think the graph is going to look a little something like thisã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_19.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_20.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_21.png)

Kind of a bizarreï¼Œ but this is the graph of sine of one over xã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_23.png)

And the idea here is that in this region where you see starts oscillating reallyï¼Œ reallyã€‚

 really really quicklyï¼Œ that's because in a tiny small interval around zero from the rightã€‚

 that what you're inputting is these bigger and bigger and bigger numbersï¼Œ a millionï¼Œ a billionã€‚

 a trillion and sign of a millionï¼Œ sign of a billionï¼Œ sign of a trillionã€‚

 these are going to be oscillating between minus1 and1 reallyï¼Œ really quicklyã€‚

 and so we get the same oscillation between minus1 and 1ã€‚

 but it's sort of compressed when you do s of1 over x insteadã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_25.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_26.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_27.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_28.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_29.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_30.png)

Okayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ now that we have what the graph of this thing looks likeï¼Œ what is the limit actuallyã€‚

 as in if I go right to zero here and I'm coming to it from the right willã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_32.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_33.png)

We never approach any one value if I'm around zeroï¼Œ sometimes I'm up here at oneã€‚

 sometimes I'm down here at minus1ï¼Œ sometimes I'm somewhere in the middleã€‚

 there's no single value whereas I get closer to zero from the right that this approaches itã€‚

 it just oscillates sort of infinitely fast as I start going towards0 from the rightã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_35.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_36.png)

So this is sort of a funky functionï¼Œ and we're going to say that this limit does not existã€‚

 or in other wordsï¼Œ DNAE Now we're going to investigate a very slightly different limitã€‚

 We're still taking the limit as x go to zero from the right and we still have a function sine of 1 over xã€‚

 but now we have this extra factor multiplied by xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_38.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_39.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_40.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_41.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_42.png)

And the difference here is that as x goes to zeroï¼Œ the function is just xã€‚

 it clearly goes to zero as wellï¼Œ so while the sine of 1 over x oscillated between the minus1 and the1 and it sort of did that going faster and faster and faster as we went towards zero from the rightã€‚

 it's now being multiplied by this other factor x that drags it down to zeroã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_44.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_45.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_46.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_47.png)

So the graph is going to look like thisã€‚X sine 1 over xã€‚

 it comes in and it wants to do that same oscillationã€‚

 but it's bounded by this graph of x and what I've put here in these blueã€‚

 I call them envelope functions and what we have is one function which is just x and another function which is minus xã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_49.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_50.png)

And then because sine of1 over x always is between plus 1 and minus1ã€‚

 then x times sine of1 over x is always between x and minus xã€‚

 so that's why I draw this graph of x and this graph of minus x there're my envelope functions and then this x sine 1 over xã€‚

 it doest sort of oscillatory behavior that it wants to doï¼Œ but it's bounded between thisã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_52.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_53.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_54.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_55.png)

So now if I look at what the limit' is going to beã€‚

 this looks like it's getting closer and closer and closer to zero and I think I can say that the limit is zeroã€‚

 and so I'm going to say that the limit as x goes to zero from the right of xã€‚

 sine of 1 over x is just going to be equal to zeroã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_57.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_58.png)

Nowï¼Œ the basic logic that we've used in this particular exampleã€‚

 I can extrapolate into its own theoremã€‚ So the way the squeeze theorem works is that you have three different functionsã€‚

 FG and Hã€‚

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_60.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_61.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_62.png)

And that the F is the smaller functionï¼Œ the H is the bigger function and the middle between the two is this function G and the G is bounded on the two sides by the F and the H and we care about this G We want to know what is the limit as we get close to some A of that Gã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_64.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_65.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_66.png)

And then what happens is that if the limit of the smaller functionï¼Œ the limit of the bigger functionã€‚

 if they're both going to be equal to some number Lã€‚

 then this function G in the middle is squeezed between them and must also have the same limit of Lã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_68.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_69.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_70.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_71.png)

So in the previous caseï¼Œ it was the xon 1 over x that we were interested inã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_73.png)

And that we were bounding it between the positive x and the minus xï¼Œ and that both of those limitsã€‚

 the limits as x and the limit of minus xï¼Œ both of those went to0 as x went to zero from the rightã€‚

 and so that the limit of the function we were actually interested in the x sine of 1 over x that it was forced to0 as wellã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_75.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_76.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_77.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_78.png)

If we want to see this example algebraicallyï¼Œ you might begin in this wayã€‚

 you might observe that minus1 is always between sine of1 over xã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_80.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_81.png)

And sine of 1 over x is always going to be less than one as wellã€‚

 that this is one of the fundamental bounds on the function signã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_83.png)

And then if this is trueï¼Œ I could then come and say that minus x is always smaller than x sine of 1 over xã€‚

 and that's going to be smaller than x in the domain where x is going to be greater than zeroã€‚



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_85.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_86.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_87.png)

And then applying the theoremï¼Œ we have our smaller function F hereã€‚

 we have our bigger function H hereï¼Œ we know that the limit as x goes to zero from the right of both xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_89.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_90.png)

And the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the functionï¼Œ minus xã€‚

 both of those are going to be equal to zeroã€‚And finallyï¼Œ that allows us to deduce that the limitã€‚

As x goes to zero from the right of the big functionã€‚

 the x sine of 1 over x that that is equal to0 by the squeeze theorem because we have these squeezed limits being the same thing and we know that what we're interested in is between these other two functions so it must be forced to zero as wellã€‚
