Let's investigate this somewhat funky limit。

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_1.png)

What we're doing is we're taking the limit is our x goes to zero from the right。

 that's what the plus deotes of sine of1 over x。

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_3.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_4.png)

So I want to figure out what does the graph of sine of1 over x actually look like？



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_6.png)

Because so let me think first about what the sine of x looks like just a self sine of x you might recall goes up and down and up and down something like this。

 and it obeys this pattern forever， it keeps going up and down and up and down and up and down。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_8.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_9.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_10.png)

So if I look at sine of1 over x now， well sine of1 over x and I'm taking numbers that are really close to zero。

 so one over a number really close to zero is a really large number like for example， if I take 0。

01 then  one over 0。01 is 100 so as these numbers x get closer and closer and closer to0。

 what's inside of the sign gets really really really big。😡。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_12.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_13.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_14.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_15.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_16.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_17.png)

But if I think about what happens as s gets really， really big sine of x itself。

 not a sine of1 over x， as sine of x goes really big， well。

 it just keeps going up and down and up and down and up and down between minus1 and one So I think the graph is going to look a little something like this。

😡。

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_19.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_20.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_21.png)

Kind of a bizarre， but this is the graph of sine of one over x。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_23.png)

And the idea here is that in this region where you see starts oscillating really， really。

 really really quickly， that's because in a tiny small interval around zero from the right。

 that what you're inputting is these bigger and bigger and bigger numbers， a million， a billion。

 a trillion and sign of a million， sign of a billion， sign of a trillion。

 these are going to be oscillating between minus1 and1 really， really quickly。

 and so we get the same oscillation between minus1 and 1。

 but it's sort of compressed when you do s of1 over x instead。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_25.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_26.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_27.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_28.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_29.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_30.png)

Okay， well， now that we have what the graph of this thing looks like， what is the limit actually。

 as in if I go right to zero here and I'm coming to it from the right will。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_32.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_33.png)

We never approach any one value if I'm around zero， sometimes I'm up here at one。

 sometimes I'm down here at minus1， sometimes I'm somewhere in the middle。

 there's no single value whereas I get closer to zero from the right that this approaches it。

 it just oscillates sort of infinitely fast as I start going towards0 from the right。😡。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_35.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_36.png)

So this is sort of a funky function， and we're going to say that this limit does not exist。

 or in other words， DNAE Now we're going to investigate a very slightly different limit。

 We're still taking the limit as x go to zero from the right and we still have a function sine of 1 over x。

 but now we have this extra factor multiplied by x。😡。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_38.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_39.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_40.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_41.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_42.png)

And the difference here is that as x goes to zero， the function is just x。

 it clearly goes to zero as well， so while the sine of 1 over x oscillated between the minus1 and the1 and it sort of did that going faster and faster and faster as we went towards zero from the right。

 it's now being multiplied by this other factor x that drags it down to zero。😡。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_44.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_45.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_46.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_47.png)

So the graph is going to look like this。X sine 1 over x。

 it comes in and it wants to do that same oscillation。

 but it's bounded by this graph of x and what I've put here in these blue。

 I call them envelope functions and what we have is one function which is just x and another function which is minus x。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_49.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_50.png)

And then because sine of1 over x always is between plus 1 and minus1。

 then x times sine of1 over x is always between x and minus x。

 so that's why I draw this graph of x and this graph of minus x there're my envelope functions and then this x sine 1 over x。

 it doest sort of oscillatory behavior that it wants to do， but it's bounded between this。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_52.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_53.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_54.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_55.png)

So now if I look at what the limit' is going to be。

 this looks like it's getting closer and closer and closer to zero and I think I can say that the limit is zero。

 and so I'm going to say that the limit as x goes to zero from the right of x。

 sine of 1 over x is just going to be equal to zero。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_57.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_58.png)

Now， the basic logic that we've used in this particular example。

 I can extrapolate into its own theorem。 So the way the squeeze theorem works is that you have three different functions。

 FG and H。

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_60.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_61.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_62.png)

And that the F is the smaller function， the H is the bigger function and the middle between the two is this function G and the G is bounded on the two sides by the F and the H and we care about this G We want to know what is the limit as we get close to some A of that G。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_64.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_65.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_66.png)

And then what happens is that if the limit of the smaller function， the limit of the bigger function。

 if they're both going to be equal to some number L。

 then this function G in the middle is squeezed between them and must also have the same limit of L。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_68.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_69.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_70.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_71.png)

So in the previous case， it was the xon 1 over x that we were interested in。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_73.png)

And that we were bounding it between the positive x and the minus x， and that both of those limits。

 the limits as x and the limit of minus x， both of those went to0 as x went to zero from the right。

 and so that the limit of the function we were actually interested in the x sine of 1 over x that it was forced to0 as well。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_75.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_76.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_77.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_78.png)

If we want to see this example algebraically， you might begin in this way。

 you might observe that minus1 is always between sine of1 over x。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_80.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_81.png)

And sine of 1 over x is always going to be less than one as well。

 that this is one of the fundamental bounds on the function sign。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_83.png)

And then if this is true， I could then come and say that minus x is always smaller than x sine of 1 over x。

 and that's going to be smaller than x in the domain where x is going to be greater than zero。



![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_85.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_86.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_87.png)

And then applying the theorem， we have our smaller function F here。

 we have our bigger function H here， we know that the limit as x goes to zero from the right of both x。

😡。

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_89.png)

![](img/ccca4617541bbba49a37db3e2dac8891_90.png)

And the limit as x goes to zero from the right of the function， minus x。

 both of those are going to be equal to zero。And finally， that allows us to deduce that the limit。

As x goes to zero from the right of the big function。

 the x sine of 1 over x that that is equal to0 by the squeeze theorem because we have these squeezed limits being the same thing and we know that what we're interested in is between these other two functions so it must be forced to zero as well。
