This video was just a little piece of algebra about inequalities and absolute values and how to deal with it whether they're all matched together。

 So let's begin with the definition of what absolute value was。 And indeed。

 I think of absolute value intuitively as if you input a positive number， you do nothing。

 But if you input a negative number like-2， the absolute value makes it positive to。

 Now I can define this as a piecewise function， which may seem a little bit strange。

 But if does the correct thing。 So， for example， if I plug into this piecewise to function The number 2。

 Well， two is greater than 0， So it would be the top condition and it wouldn't do anything an absolute value of 2 would be 2。

 But if I went and put in， say-2 here。 So the absolute value of -2。

 then that is now the second condition。 And so what it says is you take negative， whatever you have。

 So negative of this -2， which is just plus 2。 So indeed， this piecewise。😊。

Fun works for absolute value。 It makes sense with our intuition。 Now， if I have this。

 I can also shift it a little bit。 instead of absolute value of x。

 I could just have absolute value of x -2， which is literally the same thing just everywhere there was an x。

 you have now have an x-2， that's the only change I've made。 Okay， pretty good。

 So now how do we deal with absolute value combined with inequality。 So， for example。

 if I put up absolute value of x -2， which is less than 3。 Well。

 the piecewise definition here says that this really splits into two different cases here。

 One where you're saying that this business of x -2 is greater than 0。 And so always between 0 and 3。

 And the other where you say the negative of x-2 is the thing that's between the 0 and 3。

 absoluteute value is always positive always greater than 0。😊。

So you have these two different cases that we're going to have to analyze。Now， the right hand one。

 the zero less than x minus2， less than3。 what can I do。

 Well I could add two to both sides of that and that would get me that my x was between two and 5。

 pretty straightforward。However， the second one is a bit trickier because of this minus sign if I want to do say multiply all sides by minus1。

 that's okay， but it flips the inequalities。 That is what this becomes is0 greater than x minus2。

 which is greater than minus3。😡，Indeed， if you think about， say three is greater than two。

But-3 is smaller than -2。 So when you multiply by -1， the inequality has to flip with it。 Okay， well。

 now I can add 2 to both sides。 So we say two is bigger than this x -2， which is bigger than -1。

So if I put both of these cases together， so between minus1 and 2 and between two and5。

 then what I actually get here is that it's anywhere between minus1 and5。

 that's what this inequality is going to give me。We can see how this works in a number line。

 so if I put up some numbers between say minus 5 and 5。

 then what I am highlighting here in my equation this x minus2 less than 3 is all of the regions between minus1 and 5。

Now if I get rid of all of this other stuff， if I think about what this equation is。

 I have a little bit of terminology， there's something that I'm going to call a center and a radius。

 If I look at my number line here， the center of that interval is at the value of2。

 And then when you say that it's within three of it。

 I take that two and I can either go three to the one side or three to the other。

 So two down to minus1 or two up to5。 So this interval has a radius of three。

 which is just half of its total width and a center of two。 Indeed。

 this is actually how I like to think about things。 If I see an inequality like this。

 I can immediately go and write down what the number line looks like ignoring all of that business of the absolute values and the piece Y defined which are just getting this up to this particular point。

 For example， if I take a different one， see how this is x minus-2。

 I'm going to make an x plus one here。 So now if I've got x plus one Well。

 it has a different thing that I highlight on the number line。Its center is minus-1。

 General I think of it as x minus a。 So in this case。

 x minus minus1 is the center and the radius of it is2。

 so I take that two and I can go two to the one side or two to the other side。

 and that takes me between one and -3。😡。
