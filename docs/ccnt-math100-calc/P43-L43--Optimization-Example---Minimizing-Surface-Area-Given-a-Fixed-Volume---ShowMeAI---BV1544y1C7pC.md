# P43ï¼šL43- Optimization Example - Minimizing Surface Area Given a Fixed Volume - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ I'm going to be investigating a particular optimization problemã€‚

 I'm looking at what is the height of some square based box where the volume has a constraint on itã€‚

 the volume is 100 units cubedï¼Œ but what our goal is is not just any boxã€‚

 but the box that has minimal surface areaã€‚ So it's the surface area I'm trying to minimizeã€‚

 but subject to the constraint that the volume here is fixedã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_4.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_5.png)

Okayï¼Œ so what's the first sort of step in my process for optimization problemsã€‚

 I think is this we want to try to draw some picture that represents what on earth is going onã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_7.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_8.png)

So I'm going to do that and I'm going to begin by making my square box look something like this All rightã€‚

 let's see if I can drawã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_10.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_11.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_12.png)

Now drawing a picture isn't enough We also want to label this particular diagram and we want to stick with whatever labels happen to be written down This is actually quite important we don't want to just be doing a sort of derivation where you write down any symbol that isn't clearly defined so I'm going to say that I've got a base down here where the one side length is X and because it says that it's a square base box that tells me that the base has to be a square so it's actually the sort of length and width are both Xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_14.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_15.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_16.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_17.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_18.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_19.png)

And then we've got some heightï¼Œ and I'm going to call the height here Yã€‚ All rightã€‚

 now let's try to write down a couple different equationsã€‚ First of allã€‚

 I'm going to write down my constraining equationï¼Œ the volume equationï¼Œ and it says that the volumeã€‚

 which we're told is equal to 100ã€‚ Now volume of a boxï¼Œ we know what that isã€‚

 this is length time width time heightã€‚ So it's the x times x againã€‚

 So x squared all multiplied out by yã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_21.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_22.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_23.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_24.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_25.png)

Nowï¼Œ I could solve this for either X or Yï¼Œ but notice that in my questionã€‚

 one of the things that it asked for here is it askeds for the height of this thingã€‚

 I'm asking for what the y isã€‚ that's what I want to know is my final answerã€‚

 so I'm going solve this thing for the X so that I can get rid of the X is in the future so my x is all written in terms of Yã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_27.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_28.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_29.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_30.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_31.png)

I of course could have gone the other way aroundï¼Œ like could solve for y in terms of xã€‚

 but this question asks for the heightï¼Œ and so that's why I want to get rid of the X I want to have Y in my answerã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_33.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_34.png)

All rightï¼Œ so so that was the volume formulaã€‚ Now let's go and try to figure out what the surface area formula is going to be because that's what I'm going to be interested in nextã€‚

 Now my surface areaã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_36.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_37.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_38.png)

Now this surface area consists of six panelï¼Œ a bottom and a topã€‚

 then there's two sides here and another two sides there so let's try to go and figure out what this is well the bottom in the topã€‚

 what's those areasï¼Ÿ

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_40.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_41.png)

So those areasï¼Œ the bottom is going to be equal to x squaredï¼Œ and the top is exactly the sameã€‚

 So this is going to be justã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_43.png)

2 x squaredã€‚And then if I want to look atï¼Œ say this front panel hereã€‚

 it's going to be x times y and in factï¼Œ all four of these panels are exactly the same because it's x and x on the bottom or something elseã€‚

 x and2 x or x and 7ï¼Œ you'd have different panelsã€‚ but in this case because x and Xã€‚

 all four of the panels are the sameã€‚ So there's going to be four copies of x times y indeedã€‚

 if I try to fill in this front side hereï¼Œ that's going to be a height of y and at a base of x so that's my surface area formulaã€‚

 remember surface areaï¼Œ what I'm trying to minimizeã€‚

 I'm trying to find what height minimizes my surface areaã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_45.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_46.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_47.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_48.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_49.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_50.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_51.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_52.png)

All rightï¼Œ moving run alongã€‚ Now what I want to do is I want to goã€‚

 and I want to take this formula for our constraintã€‚ this Xã€‚

 and I want to plug it in anywhere where I can see an Xã€‚

 And the reason is I want my surface area only in terms of the thing I'm interested inã€‚

 I claimed I was interested in the height Yã€‚ So that's what I'm going to do if I was interested in the Xã€‚

 I would have said soï¼Œ And I'd be substitute in Yï¼Œ but I'm interested in the heightã€‚ Okayã€‚

 so let's do thisã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_54.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_55.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_56.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_57.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_58.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_59.png)

We're going to say that the surface areaï¼Œ in this caseã€‚

 because I asked for it in terms of the y is therefore equal to2ã€‚

 well x squared is going to be 100 divided by yã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_61.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_62.png)

And then x is going to be1 over square root of y times 10ã€‚

 so I think it's going to be 40 times the square root of y on top y on the top divided by square root of y leaves square root of y on the topã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_64.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_65.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_66.png)

Okayï¼Œ this is pretty goodï¼Œ so now I've got this as a function of y next stepï¼Œ differentiateã€‚

 set it equal to zeroã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_68.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_69.png)

By the wayï¼Œ I'm going to quickly pause just for long enough to note here that the domain of this equation now I clearly don't have negative y values doesn't make sense I have a negative height you can sort of debate whether you want to imagine a box with you know exactly zero height to it and sort of like infinite base a bit of a weird thing I'm going to say that my domain does not include zero and it's going to be going all the way up to infinityã€‚

 Indeed this formula hereï¼Œ the division out by why it represents this fact that the donal really want to be including zeroã€‚

 you maybe could interpret in that way if you wishã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_71.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_72.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_73.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_74.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_75.png)

Okayï¼Œ moving right alongï¼Œ now I want to go and I want to differentiate with respect to y and set it equal to zero to find all of my critical numbersã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_77.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_78.png)

If I take the derivative of my surface area with respect to y first termï¼Œ this is going to be minusã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_80.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_81.png)

200 all divided out by y squaredã€‚Plusï¼Œ derivative of y to the power of12ã€‚

 which is square root y is1 half divided by square root yã€‚

 so this is going to be equal to 20 divided by square root of yã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_83.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_84.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_85.png)

And what we're interested is to set this thing to zeroã€‚

 this is how I'm going to go and be able to find my critical numbersã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_87.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_88.png)

Alrightï¼Œ so I have this equationã€‚ I'm going to try to simplify it just a little bit to make it easier to solveã€‚

 Firstï¼Œ we're going multiply by y squaredã€‚ This is gonna tell me that -200ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_90.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_91.png)

Plusï¼Œ okayï¼Œ then if I'm multi than y squaredï¼Œ but I'm dividing by square root yã€‚

 dividing by square root y is like y to the1 halfï¼Œ so y squared divided by y to the halfã€‚

 this is going to be plus 20 y to the32s is equal to 0ï¼Œ or I can divide out by 20ã€‚

 and I can say that therefore minus 10 plus y to the power of 3/2s or equal to 0ï¼Œ or in other wordsã€‚

 I can say that y is equal to the cube root of 100 square or 10 squared10 squared which is 100ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_93.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_94.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_95.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_96.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_97.png)

All rightï¼Œ so this here is my critical numberã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_99.png)

It is the value of y where the derivative is equal to zeroã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_101.png)

But is it a minimumï¼Œ I it a maximum one of these ones that goes up and flattens out and carries onã€‚

 We don't knowã€‚ we've got a critical numberï¼Œ but we still have to investigate whether it truly is a minimumã€‚

 So the way we're going to do thisï¼Œ this is our sort of last and in some waysã€‚

 it very crucial portion is I'm going to apply the first derivativeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_103.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_104.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_105.png)

Testã€‚So let's do that and that's going to verify for me that indeed this thing that I have is going to be a minimumã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_107.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_108.png)

So how does this workï¼Œ I'm going to come along hereï¼Œ I'm going to plug on that valueã€‚

 the cube root of 100 there it isï¼Œ and what I'm interested in is what's happens to this surface area derivative to the right of the cube root of 100 and to the left of a cube root 100ã€‚

 that's what I have to investigateã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_110.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_111.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_112.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_113.png)

Wellï¼Œ the equation that I want to look at is this one right up hereã€‚

 I want to imagine that if I was to make y bigger than thisï¼Œ bigger than the cube root of 100ã€‚

 we know that at the cube root of100 this is equal to  zeroã€‚

 but if I came in here and I put in a bigger valueï¼Œ it would become more positiveã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_115.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_116.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_117.png)

And thereforeï¼Œ this left hand side would be positiveã€‚ So it's positive over hereã€‚

 But if I put in smaller valuesï¼Œ then this would be a smaller numberï¼Œ the minus-200 would be biggerã€‚

 and so it would be negativeã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_119.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_120.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_121.png)

So in other wordsï¼Œ what we have is something which is decreasing and then increasingã€‚

 so it truly is a minimumã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_123.png)

Allrightï¼Œ now let's go all the way back up to the original problem and make sure that we've actually solved itã€‚

 Okayï¼Œ so what did the original problem tell us told us we wanted the heightï¼Œ Goodã€‚

 I was doing heightï¼Œ I was figuring out whyï¼Œ but after something elseã€‚

 I would had to do something elseã€‚ I was asking for the height and And that's what I didã€‚

 What is the height of a square base box with volume 100ã€‚ Wellã€‚

 I input my constraint of volume equal to 100ã€‚ And I was minimizing the surface areaã€‚

 and not only did I minimize it and get a critical numberã€‚

 but I verified that it was indeed a minimumï¼Œ So I am contentã€‚ I believe we have solved this problemã€‚

ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_125.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_126.png)

![](img/f42fe1ab28fb33eeeed3467d912d33a2_131.png)

All rightï¼Œ so just to summarize hereï¼Œ remember that their first step is to draw that pictureã€‚

 we want to carefully label the picture where we respect whatever variables we put inside of our pictureã€‚

 we write down our constrained equation that was volume in this caseã€‚

 we write out down the thing we're trying to minimize or maximize that was the surface area go ahead and find all of the critical numbers and then when you found those critical numbers you have to testã€‚

 are they minimums or are they maximums in in this case it was a minimumã€‚
