# P33ï¼šL33- Logarithmic Differentiation _  Example - x^sinx - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

We've had a similar goal for quite some time it was compute the derivative of as many functions as possible and we have done a lotã€‚

 we figured out polynomials and trigonometric termsã€‚

 we figured out how to do things like the productï¼Œ we figured out how to do things like a compositionã€‚

 we know how to do quotationsï¼Œ we know how to do sumsï¼Œ we know an enormous amountã€‚

But there's one class that we don't know yetï¼Œ and that's exponentialsï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 we do not know how to take the derivative yet of x to the power of sine of xã€‚

So how can we solve something like thisï¼Œ what I want to useã€‚

 what I want to exploit is a nice little fact about logarithms and the fact is thisã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

If I'm going to take the natural log of A to the power of Bã€‚

 then one of the rules of logarithms is that this exponent that I haveã€‚

 it can come brought down at the front B times the natural log of Aã€‚Nowã€‚

 I want to suppose you're taking the derivative of thisã€‚If exponents are hardã€‚

 things like x to the Sineexï¼Œ if those are hardï¼Œ wellã€‚

 we do know what the derivativeruto of a product isï¼Œ we've got the product rule for thatã€‚

So because the natural log sort of transforms exponents into productsã€‚

 it's going to be able to transform something that's challenging into something that is effectively just a product ruleã€‚

 So let's see how this actually works in an exampleã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

I can take my y equal to x the power of sine of x and before I just try to compute dydxã€‚

 I'm going to go and take the natural log of both sides firstã€‚

 that is I'm going to compute the natural log of y and the natural log of the x to the power of sine of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then our goal is going to beï¼Œ if I have it written in this formã€‚

 I'm going to take the derivative of both sides hereã€‚

Now why have I helped myself the key idea is thisï¼Œ I've got the x to the sine of xã€‚

 this is kind of like an A to the Bï¼Œ and I can apply my log ruleã€‚

 I can take this sine of x and I can bring it downã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So what this is going to have on the right hand side is the derivative of the sine of x times the natural log of xã€‚

What happened over here on the left Well this is a chain ruleï¼Œ an outside functionã€‚

 the natural logarithmï¼Œ the inside function y of xã€‚

 so what's is derivative is the drew to the outside which is one over whatever the inside is one over y times the drew to the inside D Y dx that's me apply my chain rule so I applied my chain rule over hereã€‚

 Ive applied a log rule over thereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒI can take the derivative of a productã€‚

 I'm going take the derivative of sine times the natural logarm of Xã€‚ I just use the product ruleã€‚

 So what do I haveã€‚ I'm gonna to leave the lefthand sideã€‚

 sine goes to cos plus the natural log plus sine times the derivative of the natural log which is one over Xã€‚

 So I've applied my product rule hereã€‚ so I'm happy with thisã€‚

 but I want to do a little bit more workã€‚ Let's get rid of all this other nonsenseã€‚

 What I want to do is I don't want this y here any longerã€‚

 I want my derivative just to be some function of xã€‚ So I want to manipulate thisã€‚

 but I can both move the y up to the other sideã€‚ and I know that y is x to the power of sine of xã€‚

 So I can isolate it and take this y here move it over and what I get is the derivative respect to x is there's the y x to sine of x times all of this other stuffã€‚

 So that is my final answer for the derivative with respect to x of this function X to the sine of xã€‚

 And you can see that it is kind of a long and messy expression hereã€‚

 But this is just how this logarithmic differentiation worksã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Its it possible for us to compute a derivative that we didn't know how to do beforeã€‚
