Consider the graphs of two different sequences。 First， I graphed a random A that I made up。

 and then I went and graph the absolute value of that same sequence。 And in the top sequence A。

 there was some positive and negative terms。 When I take the absolute value。

 it takes all of those negatives and makes them all positives。 Now， this is a sequence。

 And in both of these sequences， at least visually it appears that the limit is going be0。

 But just because the limit of the terms goes to0 doesn't say anything about what the series does。

 So let's investigate that。 Let's compare the series that adds up the A to the series that adds up the absolute value of the A N。

 Now， because I program this in。 I happen to know what the series is。

 this is the series-1 to the n-1 all of it to by square root of n。 So the absolute value。

 the effect it has。 is it just takes all that -1 stuff and gets rid of it。

 It just all turns it into plus one。 Now， these two sequences are ones that we can do by。😊。

methods we've seen the top1， it's an alternating thing with the -1 to the M minus-1 and then it multiplies it by one over squared n。

 which is a positive decreasing sequence with limit0。

 It satisfies all conditions of the alternating series test。

 So the top one indeed converges by the alternating series test As for the bottom one。

 this is a P test， it's say P with n equal to one。 And so this is a P series that diverges。

 So the lesson here is that taking absolute values of the terms makes a big deal。

 and this example it converts it from a convergent to a divergent series。

 Now why might that be the case。 If you think about the one with positives and negatives。

 when you take a positive term and you add it to a negative term。

 it cancels maybe not entirely or all the way。 but the combination of positives and negatives they don't add up as much as only adding positives or alternatively only adding negatives together。

 So when you take the absolute value， you get rid of。Any form of internal cancellation that you have。

 So it would make sense that the absolute value one would be the larger that it might diverge。

 even though the one with the minus signs that converged。 And indeed， this is generally the case。

 So a theorem that we have is that if the sum of the absolute value of the ANs converges。

 then the original series with just the anNs that converges as well。

 It says that you put this absolute value around it， you have a stronger condition。

 So when you know it converges with the absolute there， then it converges without them。

 Indeed a little bit of terminology here， we'll say that absolute convergence。

 that expression is what we mean when we take the sum of the absolute value of ANs。

 So another way to say this is that if it converges absolutely。

 then it converges in the normal old sense。But the other direction is not true。

 If something converges， like in the example we saw before that converged by the alternating series test。

 it does not necessarily converge absolutely。 It might， but it might not。

 And in that scenario where it doesn't。 We call this conditional convergence。

 So conditional convergence is where the original series converge as。

 but does not converge absolutely。 It doesn't converge when you wrap it in absolute value signs。

 Indeed this example that we started the video with this -1 to the M -1 over root N。

 that was a conditionally convergt series， It converged。But it didn't converge absolutely。

 so these are just a couple little pieces of terminologies that are going to be very important for our next test。

 the ratio test and the root test。😡。
