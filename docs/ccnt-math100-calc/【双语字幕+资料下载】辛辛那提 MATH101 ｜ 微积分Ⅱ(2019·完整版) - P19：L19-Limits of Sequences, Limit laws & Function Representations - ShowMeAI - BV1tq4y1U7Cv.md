。In the first video on sequences， we saw two different ways about talking about sequences。

 I could write down just a list of the elements in the sequence the first term， the second term。

 the third term， and so on， or I can give you an explicit formula for it。

 I could say the sequence a sub n is equal to， and I gave you some formula like， for example。

1 over n。Now， in this video， I'm going to begin with a third way that we can talk about sequences。

 Indeed， if I think about one over ring， we are very familiar with the function one over x。

 So let me put that up on the screen。 Indeed we can graph it。 This is the function one over x。

 and the key thing here is that when we've done calculus before， the X is allowed to be real numbers。

 So I can go inside of this x， and I can plug it not just one，2，3。

 but a half and a third and also irrational numbers like pi and root 2 and E。

 So I'm allowed to have any input that least is in the domain of this particular function。😊。

But a sequence is something that only has a first term， a second term， and a third term。

 it doesn't have a half a term or a pipe of a term。

 this doesn't make any sense to the notion of a sequence。So what about this。

 What if I take this function， I restrict my domain。 So instead of having it F of X。

 what I'm going to do instead is F of N where the n here。

 the argument of my function is restricted to only be national numbers，1，2，3，4， and so on。😡。

So if I do this， that defines a sequence for every value n that I might have。

 That's a natural number。 I have an output。 I have a value。 That is my sequence。

 So I can say that this way of writing it， I'm going to indeed put in a list of points。

 the blue dots here are for the n equal to1 n equal to2 n equal to 3 and so on。

 and I'm going to call that my a sub n。 So if you just have some function of a real variable that at least has to be defined for the natural numbers。

 then you can make a sequence out of it by only considering what happens to the function at the natural numbers and calling that your a sub n。

😡，And so in this specific example where my original function was1 over x。

 I'll say my sequence is1 over n。 and I'm going to try to be consistent with my notation。

 We're going to use x when we're talking about a real value of things that could take any value。

 we're going to use n when we're only to allowed natural numbers，1，2，3，4 and so on。 Indeed。

 if I want to think about like one specific one like this blue dot。 Well， this dot。

 it's occurring at the n value of 2。 and it has a height of whatever f of two is in this particular case。

1 over 2， this one half or the value a sub2。 So in a sense。

 you can graph a sequence heck if we want to， we can get rid of the original function entirely and just consider the list of dots。

 that is the graph of my sequence。The next thing I want to do is talk about the limit of sequences as your n goes to infinity that might be complicated。

 but we do know a lot about the limit of functions as x goes to infinity。

 we study these extensively in calculus 1 and I'm going to relate them in the following way。

 so I'm going to suppose that we know that the horizontal asyd of f of x that is the limit as x goes to infinity of f of x that that converges to a value of L。

Well， if that's the case， then the sequence that comes from that f of x。

 if AN is just the f at the values of n， then the limit is n goes to infinity of the sequence of the a sub ns is also L indeed if we look at the graph that we have as it goes off towards infinity。

 the graph of1 over x and the graph of the sequence1 over n。

1 over n is just restricted to whatever1 over x does， So if the f of x is going to go to some value。

 the a sub n is forced to the same value indeed in our specific example where we're talking about f of x is1 over x we know and we've seen it all the way back in calculus 1。

 that the limit is f goes to infinity of the1 over x is just zero。

 but that also implies that the limit as n goes to infinity of the a sub ns of the1 over ns is also zero。

Now， truth be told back in calculus 1， we were always a little bit mathematically imprecise about exactly the rigorous definition of a limit。

 We'd say something like this limit x goes to infinity of f of x is equal to L。

 if the function gets as close as you might wish to the limit as your x's get large and I'm going to be similarly inreci here for the definition of the limit of a sequence。

 I'll say that the ANs go to L。 if the anNs get as close to L as you might wish as your M values get arbitrarily large。

 Now， one of the big benefits of this overlap between functions and sequences and their notions of limits is that all of those rules that we had for limits for functions。

 they translate over So for example， the limit of the sum or the difference of two sequences is just the sum or the difference of the individual sequences。

 if you multiply， for example， by some real number constant the limit of the constant times。

you can just take that constant and move it all the way out the front。

 so it's a constant times the limit of the sequence， you can do the same for multiplication。

 you can do the same thing for division when your denominator is nonzero and indeed my favorite of the all is that if you have a continuous function you can interchange the limit and a function here's what I mean if I have F of S continuous and I take the limit of F of a sequence and this is just the same thing is taking the function of the limit of the sequence and that works when the function is continuous。

So all of these different limit laws， we had the corresponding ones for real valued functions and we get them again for sequences in much the same way。

Now， how could I use this。 Here's a specific example。 So in this next example。

 I have some pretty gnarly expression。 It is a sequence for every value of n。

 I could plug it in here。 I could get the inside。 I could get the cosine。

 but what's it going be equal to。 Well let's apply a bunch of our rules。

 The first thing we know is cosine is a continuous function。

 So I can swap the cosine and the limit sign。 so I'll just take the limit and move it to the inside。

😡，Second， in this numerator I have an addition between two different things。

 so maybe I'll break it up that way， I'll say that this is the limit of1 over n and the limit of 1 over n squared。

😡，And then both of these individual limits we know one over n as n goes large is going to go to zero。

 one over n squared as n goes large is going to go to zero。

 so really what we have is cosine of0 plus0 and we know what cosine of zero is it's one。Now。

 truth be told， I actually don't normally go the entire rigorous way of applying all of these formal limit laws。

 I just look at the original expression。 I say inside the cosine。

 I can see that it's going to be going down to0。 and so it's going to go to co of 0， which is one。😡。

But the reason I'm allowed to do this that I can just immediately look at this first one and just claim it's one is indeed because we have all of these limit loss。

Finally， let to one example that actually doesn't converge。

 If I look at this -1 to the n and try to write at its first few terms。

 it alternates between -1 and 1 and -1 and 1 and so on。 Now。

 recall that the definition of a limit is that the sequence get arbitrarily close to some value L when your n gets fairly large。

 it's true that as your n gets large， this often hits the value of 1， but not always that。

 it os between 1 and -1，1 and -1，1 and -1， it never settles at any particular value。

 And so what do we say we say that this particular limit does not exist。So indeed。

 we've seen that if I give you some sequence， sometimes it's going to exist and sometimes it is not going to exist。

 we're going to have to study， we're going to apply limit laws and we're going to have to think about the definitions。

😡。
