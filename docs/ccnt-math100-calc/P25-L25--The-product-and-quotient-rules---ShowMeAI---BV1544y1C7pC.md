# P25ï¼šL25- The product and quotient rules - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Our goal remainsï¼Œ as it was beforeã€‚ Let's find as many different functions as we can that we can take the derivatives ofã€‚

 We currently know exponentialsã€‚ We know polynomialsã€‚

 We know sums of those things and scalar multiples of those thingsã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So what we're going to focus in on this video is products and quotients of functionsã€‚

 so that is examples like x cubed times ED the x that's a product of two functions a product of x cubed and ED the x or the derivative of X cubed divided by the ED thex that's going to be a quotientã€‚

 so how do we take the derivatives of those kind of thingsï¼Ÿ

The rule for the derivative of a product goes like thisã€‚The derivativeã€‚

 that's what the prime means of a productã€‚ F times G is going to be the derivativeã€‚

 the first thing times a second plus the first thing times the derivative of the secondã€‚

 So F prime G plus F G primeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Notice what this isn'tã€‚ This is not F prime times G primeã€‚ You might expect thatã€‚

 it might seem reasonableï¼Œ but indeedï¼Œ if you pause the video and look at the example x squaredã€‚

 which can be thought of as x times Xã€‚ And we know that the derivative of x squared is gonna be2 xã€‚

 but if you apply that wrong ruleï¼Œ F prime times G primeï¼Œ you'll get a wrong or sumã€‚

 So instead the product rule a little bit more complicatedã€‚

 It's not that the derivative of a product is a product of the derivativesã€‚

 The derivative of a sum is the sum of two derivativesï¼Œ but this is not true for productã€‚

 just kind of interestingã€‚ Nowï¼Œ this is written in the laggangrange notationã€‚

 but you can also use a leman notationã€‚ So it's a little bit longerï¼Œ but it's the same thingã€‚

 The derivative of a product is the derivative of the first times the secondã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Plus the first times the derivative of a secondã€‚But I usually like to go the F prime G plus FG prime notation doesn't really matter too muchã€‚

 Now let's see a specific exampleã€‚ I want to take the derivative of x cubed times e to the xã€‚

And the first thing I need to do is identify what is the F and what is the Gã€‚ So the x cubed hereã€‚

 this is going to be my Fã€‚And then the E to the xï¼Œ that is going to be my Gã€‚

And then if I look at what my formula doesï¼Œ I'm trying to say that this is going to be equal to somethingã€‚

 Well what am I going to doï¼Œ I'm just going to go along this formula and apply all these things in turnã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo F prime is the derivative of x cubedï¼Œ and we know what the derivative of a power isã€‚

 we use the power rule as 3 x squaredï¼Œ so this is going to beï¼Œ first of allï¼Œ a3 x squaredã€‚Allrightã€‚

 now next up it's going to be this F prime times a G and the G is to t to the x and it's just Gã€‚

 so I just copy it downã€‚ So E to the power of xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/0384241672ffe6b2ea1978a72e1dd49b_3.png)

Next upï¼Œ I'm going to be adding Fã€‚ So just copying and pasting my F one more timeã€‚

 So let's add in my Fã€‚ it's going to be adding in an next cubeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/0384241672ffe6b2ea1978a72e1dd49b_5.png)

And then finally it's the G primeï¼Œ and remember from the previous videoã€‚

 the derivative of e to the x is just E to the x againã€‚

 so this is going to be x cubed times E to the power of xã€‚

So this product rule allows us with not a huge amount of effort to figure out the derivative of the product of these two thingsã€‚

 because I know the derivatives of the individual factorsï¼Œ the F and the Gã€‚Next upã€‚

 we're going to look at the quotient ruleï¼Œ and this is now the derivative of f divided by Gã€‚

 and this is of course going to apply when my G is non zeroã€‚

So what it is is you have to be very careful here with the orderï¼Œ it's the F prime Gã€‚

 not a plus minus this time an Fg primeï¼Œ so it's very similar to the product rule on the top with a minus signã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then divided out by the bottom squareï¼Œ divided out by the G squaredã€‚

 So this is just some particular ruleã€‚ So now let's do an example like thisã€‚

 I'm taking the derivative of this x cubedã€‚ And I'm just going apply my formulaã€‚

 So the F is on the topã€‚ the x cubedã€‚ the G is on the bottom that E to the Xã€‚

 And what my formula tells me to do is first is F primeã€‚

 So derivative of the x cubed is3 x squared as we had beforeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Then I'm going to copy and paste the G there it isï¼Œ just copy and paste itã€‚

 so times e to the power of xã€‚Minus that's very important I use a minus site now I'm minus off Fg primeã€‚

 so F is just the x cubed again and the derivative of e to the x is again e to the xã€‚

 so it looks the sameï¼Œ but I'm taking it derivative enoughã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo that's the topã€‚

 And then all the bottom of this is going to be divided by G squaredã€‚ So in other wordsã€‚

 E to the X squaredã€‚ And by the laws of exponentsï¼Œ we can write this as E to the power of 2 xã€‚

If you want toï¼Œ you could clean this up a little bitã€‚

 I noticed there's an EDD X on the top and then there's e to the2 x on the bottom so we could rewrite this as 3 x squared minus x cubedã€‚

 so I've gotten rid of the EDD X's on the top and now it's just divided out by EDD X on the bottomã€‚

 just a little bit of algebraã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo where are we at we've got the same two sort of base functionsã€‚

 the E to the X and the x to the nï¼Œ the powersï¼Œ but now I've added a few more rulesã€‚

 not just addivity and scalar multiplicationï¼Œ but also the ability to take quots and products and of course these rules are going to apply in places where the individual F primes and G primes are all existing So as we go forward we're going to add some more base functions down here and we're going to add some more rules up here that's going to allow us to take the derivative of just this enormous class of functionsã€‚
