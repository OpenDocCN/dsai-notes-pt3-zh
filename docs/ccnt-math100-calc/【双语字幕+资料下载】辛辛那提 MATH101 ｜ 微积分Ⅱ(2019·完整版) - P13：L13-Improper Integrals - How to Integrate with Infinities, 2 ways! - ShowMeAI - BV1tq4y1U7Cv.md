# P13ï¼šL13-Improper Integrals - How to Integrate with Infinities, 2 ways! - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

The function1 over x is kind of interesting when you try to consider what is the area under the curve of1 over xã€‚

 because there's actually two different kinds of going off towards infinity hereã€‚

 there's a vertical asyte where as S goes to0 from the rightã€‚

 the function goes out to positive infinityã€‚ There's also a horizontal lasyt is S goes to positive infinityã€‚

 the function comes down and gets closer and closer and closer to0ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 if I focus on a particular region like between1 and2ã€‚

 the area under the curve between 1 and 2 is given by the definite integralã€‚

 The integral from 1 to 2 of one over x dxã€‚ And this integral is reasonable to computeã€‚

 an antider for one over x is logarithm of the absolute value of x if I evaluate 2 and evaluate that1 because logarm of1 is 0ã€‚

 that means that this is just equal to the logarithm of 2ï¼Œ it's computableã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒHoweverã€‚

 there's two other regions here I might be interested inï¼Œ For exampleï¼Œ there's this blue regionã€‚

 This isï¼Œ in some senseï¼Œ the integral from 0 to 1ï¼Œ whatever that might mean of one over Xdxã€‚

 and then there's integral from two up to infinity of one over X dx And then there's several questions Like first of allã€‚

 how are these even definedï¼Œ how do we define integrationã€‚

 we have a discontinuity like this division by zero or when we're setting our domain of it to be going all the way off to infinityã€‚

 How' is it defined and then are these positive numbersã€‚

 are they going off to positive infinity themselvesï¼Œ you might thinkï¼Œ well lookã€‚

 there's two different infinitiesï¼Œ both of these areas are both infiniteã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

If you recall when we were doing limits back in calculus1ã€‚

 there were all kinds of functions like sayï¼Œ arc tangentï¼Œ where the function was increasingã€‚

 increasing increasingï¼Œ but it would level offã€‚ So in this integral from one to infinityï¼Œ yesã€‚

 the area is getting bigger and bigger and biggerï¼Œ the further you go off to the rightã€‚

 But does it converge in some valueã€‚ or does it really go and stretch off deposit infinityã€‚

 So we need to make precise these concepts and compute the values if they indeed convergeã€‚

 So let me focus on the two up to infinity integral firstã€‚

 The thing that's problematic for me is the infinity sideã€‚

 So what I'm going to try to do is consider something slightly differentã€‚

 That is the integral of one over xï¼Œ but not from2 to infinity 2 to some t value where t is just a number that's greater than 2ã€‚

 I'm thinking that t here might be 7 or 100 or a million or a trillionï¼Œ but it's always a numberã€‚

 And if it's a numberï¼Œ I can do this integralã€‚ So this integral is actually a function ofã€‚

TFor every input Tï¼Œ you get a different number out of itã€‚ And if it's a function of Tã€‚

 I can take its limit as t goes to infinityã€‚ So that is how I'm going to define the socalled improper integral from2 all the way up to infinityã€‚

 It's2 up to T where I then take the limit as T goes to infinityã€‚ Nowï¼Œ why is this helpfulã€‚

 I'm not going to touch the limit sign for a momentã€‚

 I'm just going to do this integral with this arbitrary T thereã€‚ And this is straightforwardã€‚

 It's the logarithm of T minus the logarithm of2ã€‚And now this is just some functionã€‚

 And I am asking what some limit of some function isã€‚ Wellã€‚

 just depends on what logarithm looks likeã€‚ So here's what the graph of logarithm isã€‚

 And you'll notice about this is that if t goes to infinityã€‚

 then the logarithm is also going to go to infinityã€‚ And so as a resultã€‚

 this thing is just equal to infinityã€‚Okayï¼Œ you might be telling me this is kind of sillyã€‚

 It was going off towards Infinityã€‚ The answer is Infinity is sort of what you expectedã€‚

 Am I really doing anything while of thisã€‚ Wellï¼Œ let me give you a different exampleã€‚ Rememberã€‚

 we were focusing on the green region here for one over Xã€‚

 but let me change the function just the tiniest little bitã€‚ Let me make it one over x squared nowã€‚

For one over x squaredï¼Œ because the x squared is bigger than xï¼Œ I'm dividing by itã€‚

 What really happens is the green region got a bit smaller and the blue a little bit biggerã€‚

 let me go backã€‚ So this is1 over xã€‚ you see the green region is a little bit bigger hereã€‚

 And now if I go to one over x squaredï¼Œ it compresses faster and the green region is a little bit smallerã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe original for one over x goes to infinityï¼Œ But what about for one over x squaredã€‚

 what happens thereã€‚ So if I focus in on that integralã€‚

 I'm going to apply my definitions just as I have beforeã€‚ Wellã€‚

 this is the limit as t goes to infinityã€‚ The integral from 2 up to T of1 over x squared d X1 over x squared is something I can doã€‚

 So I'll leave the limit out the frontã€‚ and I just get an anti derivative of 1 over x between1 and Tã€‚

 I evaluate thatã€‚ And so I get minus1 over t minus minus1 over 2ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And now I can do this if I plug in t to infinity1 over infinity is just going to go to 0ã€‚

 but that one half that we still have hereï¼Œ it doesn't go awayã€‚

 So this indeed is just the value one halfã€‚Okayï¼Œ so that's the green onesã€‚

 That's going off to infinityã€‚ That's our case 1ã€‚ What about case 2 In case 2ã€‚

 we're talking about these integrals from 0 to1ï¼Œ where I have a discontinunuityã€‚

 I have a vertical aintote at 0ã€‚ So let's focus on that particular integralã€‚

I want to do the same sort of trickã€‚ replace it with a t instead of a 0 because0 is my pro spot 0 is my spike to infinityã€‚

 But now my limit is not going to be when t goes to infinityï¼Œ It's when t goes to 0ã€‚

 and in particularï¼Œ when t goes to 0 from the rightã€‚ So instead of having0 to1ï¼Œ I have t up to1ã€‚

 And I imagine t is an number like 01010001ã€‚ againã€‚

 I can leave the limit off the right hand side and I can compute thisã€‚

 the antider or an anti derivative one over x is the logarithm of as value of xã€‚

 I plug in1 and I plug in t and what do I getã€‚ Wellï¼Œ logarithm of1 is 0ã€‚

 So I'm just subtracting off the logarithm of the absolute value of tã€‚ Wellï¼Œ what's logarithm of tã€‚

 when t is going to 0 from the rightï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ what's our graph of logarithm there it is once againã€‚

 And you'll notice about logarithm that it has this vertical asympoid to 0ã€‚

 It goes down to minus infinityã€‚ Well because it's minus the logarithm of thisã€‚

 minus minus is positiveã€‚ So againï¼Œ this is gonna to go to infinityã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo for the function1 over xã€‚

 we've seen that the blue region as well also is going to go to infinityã€‚ Wellã€‚

 is that always the case Againï¼Œ it's not always the caseã€‚ Okayï¼Œ so let me give you a new exampleã€‚

 instead of one over xã€‚ I'm going to give you1 over square root of x1 over square root of x grows more slowly as x goes really largeã€‚

 So now the green region is bigger and the blue region is smallerã€‚

 so let's focus in on the blue regionï¼Œ the integral from 0 to1ã€‚ I know how to do this nowã€‚

 it's going to be the limit as t goes to 0 from the right of the integral of t up to infinity of1 over root x d xã€‚

 And I know how to do this integralgra it's just going to be a power ruleã€‚

 So I leave the limit out the frontã€‚ the limit of two times root xã€‚

 and I'm evaluating between t and1ã€‚ if I plug those values inã€‚

 I'm going to get a2 minus2 root t Now it's a question of doing the limit I'll remind that the graph of root x looks like this as you send this value to 0ã€‚

 you consider root t is t goes to0ï¼Œ you just indeed getã€‚

So that leaves behind only the two of the frontï¼Œ and so this value is2ã€‚

So what we've seen in these examples is that for either case1ã€‚

 which is when you have one of the bounds of integration being infinity that that may or may not converge to a finite numberã€‚

 or it may diverge to infinityã€‚ and likewiseï¼Œ when you have a vertical asintoteã€‚ So a discontinuityã€‚

 a spike to infinityï¼Œ a zero in the denominatorï¼Œ againï¼Œ you can do a very similar trick with a limitã€‚

 and there againï¼Œ it may converge to a number or it may divergeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒFinallyã€‚

 I want to talk about the sort of more general caseã€‚

 If I take the limit from minus infinity all the way up to infinityï¼Œ So I'm doing it on both sidesã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ I just do a sumã€‚ I just choose some random value in the middle like aã€‚

 and then I do integral from T all the way up to A and from a all the way up to Tã€‚

 and then I take those t values either to minus infinity or plus infinityã€‚

 I can do both sides of it sort of separately when I break it up at some middle point Aã€‚

 And then likewiseï¼Œ if my point of discontinuity is somewhere in the middleã€‚

 So my C is my problem spot So then what I can do is take this integral from a up to B and I break it up is integral from A up to T and T up to Bã€‚

 and the t valuesï¼Œ I either send to C from the left or C from the rightã€‚

 depending know which side it isã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then finally you can combine theseã€‚

 you could have a whole bunch of different discontinunuities and combine those with limits at infinityã€‚

 it doesn't really matter you just break it up into as many cases as you need to doã€‚

So for these improper integralsï¼Œ it's just a question of converting into a limitã€‚

 evaluating the functions in the normal wayï¼Œ doing those integralsï¼Œ and then computing the limitsã€‚

 and they either converge or diverge depending on whether the limits converge or divergeã€‚
