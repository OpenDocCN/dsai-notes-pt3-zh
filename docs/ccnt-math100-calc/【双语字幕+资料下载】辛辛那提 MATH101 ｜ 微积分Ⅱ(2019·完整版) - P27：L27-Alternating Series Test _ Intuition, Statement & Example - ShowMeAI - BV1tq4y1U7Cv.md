# P27ï¼šL27-Alternating Series Test _ Intuition, Statement & Example - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Recall the harmonic seriesï¼Œ the sum of one and a half and a third and a quarter and so onã€‚

 This was a series that we saw previously divergedã€‚ But in this videoã€‚

 I want to consider a bit of a twist on this harmonic seriesï¼Œ It sort of alternating harmonic seriesã€‚

 this is now the sum of-1 to the power of M -1 divided by nã€‚ And what that-1 thing doesã€‚

 is it means that every other sign is negative goes positiveï¼Œ negativeï¼Œ positive negative and so onã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ well the original harmonic seriesã€‚ the one over n divrgedã€‚

 There's definitely an open question about this oneï¼Œ because if you think about itã€‚

 all of those negativesï¼Œ in a senseï¼Œ can law versus adding to the larger totalã€‚

 So here's how I want to try to visualize what this alternating series doesã€‚

 Imagine I start with the number line hereï¼Œ starts a 0 and goes out to say1ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 if I consider just this first partial sumï¼Œ I started the0 when I go out to oneã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

But then when I go to the second partial sumï¼Œ I also have to subtract off a halfã€‚

 So let me subtract off the halfã€‚ and this takes me to S2ï¼Œ the second partial sumã€‚

 which occurs at one minus half or a halfã€‚ as in I took a big step out and then a smaller step back well now I need to step out one thirdã€‚

 So I advance to my S3 and then I step backwards to get to my S4ã€‚

 and then I advanced my S5 and backwards of my S6 and advanced with my S7 and so onã€‚

 that is because of the nature of this alternating seriesã€‚

 there's the sort of back and forth processã€‚ and it kind of looks like it's going to converge that the actual value of the series is going to be stuck somewhere here in the middleã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ if we look at all the even partial sumsï¼Œ the S2ï¼Œ the S4ï¼Œ the S6ã€‚

 the even sums is an increasing sequenceã€‚ Wellï¼Œ the odd partial sumsï¼Œ S3ï¼Œ the S5ï¼Œ the S7ã€‚

 that is a decreasing1 it's getting smallerã€‚ So the finalã€‚

Answer appears to be squished between these two different sidesã€‚

 Let's formalize this idea into a theoremã€‚ I'm going to say that the alternating series test says if I begin with an alternating seriesã€‚

 So1 to the n-1 times a Bn some sequence that looks a lot like it did for the harmonic series where it's going to be decreasing where it's going to be positive and where the limit is0ã€‚

 if all of those conditions are trueï¼Œ then we conclude that the series converges and that is our alternating series testã€‚

 let's see it for the specific exampleã€‚ So for this exampleï¼Œ this1 to the n -1 divided up by nã€‚

 what do we haveï¼Œ It's certainly going to be the case that the Bn is positiveã€‚

 So the Bn in this example is just1 over nã€‚ It's positiveã€‚

 It's decreasing as n gets larger1 over n gets smaller and the limit of one over n is just0ã€‚

 So this satisfies all three conditions of the alternating series testã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And so we say that it convergesã€‚Nowï¼Œ alternating series are really niceã€‚

 And part of the reason why they're so nice is that they're easy to checkã€‚

 That is this final condition that the limit of the Bns goes to0ã€‚ Wellã€‚

 limits of sequence are relatively easy to compute Theyre using a lot of the same sort of calculus 1 methods that we did for limit 7 infinityã€‚

 sort of a highest power on the top divided by highest power on the bottom type of analysisã€‚

 But I want to contrast this with a different theorem that we've seenã€‚

 which was the divergence theoremã€‚ So how did the divergence theorem workã€‚

 It said if you take the limit of the sequenceã€‚ and the limit of the sequence is nonzeroã€‚

 then the sequence divergedã€‚ And this makes sense because suppose your limit of your sequence wasã€‚

 I don't know 7ã€‚ Wellï¼Œ then the series would be getting very close to 7 plus 7 plus 7 plus 7ã€‚

 which would divergeã€‚ So indeedï¼Œ it said you had to have the limit being 0ã€‚

 if you wanted it to convergeã€‚ But notice that this isã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

If and only if it's not a statement with a converse that goes the other directionï¼Œ namelyã€‚

 it only works in the directionã€‚ If it is non-zeroï¼Œ then it divergesã€‚ if the limit was0ã€‚

 the divergence test doesn't tell you anything at allã€‚

 So how can I think about the alternating series testã€‚ Wellã€‚

 the alternating series test is like partially go in the other direction of the divergence test It saidã€‚

 wellï¼Œ if the limit is zero and you have these other things it needs to be alternating it if you to have positive termsã€‚

 it needs to be decreasingã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen you get convergenceã€‚ So if you have the limit being 0ã€‚

 but you don't have any of those other thingsï¼Œ there's no guarantee that it convergesã€‚

 If the limit is non zeroï¼Œ then it does guarantee its divergence by the divergence testã€‚

 So I think of these two tests related in that senseã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
