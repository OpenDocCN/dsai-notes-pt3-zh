# P48ï¼šL48-Intro to COMPLEX NUMBERS _ Motivation, Algebraic Definition & Fundamental - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Welcome to my new series on complex and imaginary numbers Over the course of the next couple of videosã€‚

 I want to convince you that despite the kind of mystical namesï¼Œ complex and imaginary numbersã€‚

 these objects in mathematics are actually very natural and powerful tools to solve many different types of problems in mathematic science engineering in this first videoã€‚

 we're really going to focus on an algebraic picture why we think that complex numbers are helpful to us algebraically and some of the advantages that complex numbers give in the next videoã€‚

 we're gonna talk about the geometric picture of complex numbersã€‚ And then finallyã€‚

 in the third videoï¼Œ we're going to talk about a very powerful feature of complex numbersã€‚

 which is writing them in polar formã€‚ It's going to make our lives a lot easier and allow us to have nice answers to things like what's the Q root of-1ã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAll rightï¼Œ so let's begin with these three different equationsï¼Œ x squared is4ï¼Œ x squared is2ã€‚

 x squared is minus1ï¼Œ and the question isï¼Œ can we solve themï¼ŸWellã€‚

 the first of these is straightforwardï¼Œ the solution is x is 2 or minus2ã€‚

 you plug either those numbers inï¼Œ you square it and you get fourã€‚Because 2 and -2 or integersã€‚

 I don't think anyone probably has a problem with thatã€‚ But maybe you do with the second oneã€‚

 The second equation squared equal to 2ã€‚ Wellï¼Œ when you solve thatã€‚

 I can write down x is square root of 2 and x is minus square root of 2ã€‚

 But what really is the square root of2ã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ square root 2 is a very bizarre thingã€‚

 It's not a rational numberã€‚ you can prove that it's not fraction like 3 over 7 is it's something with an infinite non repeatpeing decimal expansionã€‚

 but does not even really existã€‚ So the idea is that the symbol root 2 and minus root 2ã€‚

 These things are definitionã€‚ They are defining the concept of the number that is the solution to x squared equal to 2ã€‚

 So there's already a little bit of a mystical wherere sort of defining things kind of vein going onã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo if you're happy with thatï¼Œ you're happy with the idea that we can define solutions to equationsã€‚

 then perhaps you'll be also happy with the next oneï¼Œ the solution to x squared equal to minus1ã€‚

If I take square roots of both sides that would give me x equal to square root of minus1 and the negative square root of minus1 Now when you square a real numberã€‚

 like seven squared is 49ï¼Œ it minus7 squared is also 49ã€‚

 whether it's positive or negative either way it's squared to a positiveã€‚

So the square root of a negative number should cause a lot of anxiety to youã€‚

 but I'm just going to define it to be something In fact I'm even going to relabel it because it's going to be important enoughã€‚

 I'm going to relabel the square root of minus1ï¼Œ I'm going to shorthand to that symbol and call it instead the symbol I and minus I and what I'm really doing is just defining this new symbol I or negative I to be the objects that solve the equation x squared equal to minus1ã€‚

I'm sort of continuing my analogy with the way we came up with root 2ã€‚

 So you might be left with the impression that if I'm going to be comfortable doing thatã€‚

 that the cat's kind of out of the bag and we're gonna to have a huge number of new symbols we willll have to defineã€‚

 For exampleï¼Œ if I consider some other quadratic equationã€‚

 how about x squared plus x plus  one equal to0ã€‚ Okayï¼Œ wellã€‚

 maybe you'll have to find some new symbols yet again for the solutions to thisã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Except this has a quadratic formulaï¼Œ we could plug that in and get x'sã€‚

 but normally it's minus b plus or minus a square root of b squared minus4 you see all divided by 2aã€‚

 that formulaï¼Œ so in this caseï¼Œ minus1 plus or minus square root of 1 minus4 and then divided by 2ã€‚

And then if I just simplify that a little bitï¼Œ okayï¼Œ one minus four here is negative threeã€‚

And then square root of negative3 can be thought of as square root of minus1 times square root of 3ã€‚

 and square root of minus1 we had defined to be Iã€‚So what do I get negative1 half plus or minus I square root of3 and divided divided by2 The point here is that I haven't had to come up with yet another new symbol that the I I already defined was enough by the quadratic formula I got this thing with that square root of minus1ã€‚

 but I'd already defined that thing to be this symbol that we call Iã€‚

Now I'll note that in this case there's a portion at the beginning that does not have an I attached to itã€‚

 I'm going to call that A in the futureï¼Œ and then there's something that's got an I times well three over two in this caseã€‚

 and I'm going to call that I times B in the futureã€‚

And it's worth noting that the quadratic formula always works this way it always has this square rootã€‚

 the square roots either positiveï¼Œ in which case it's just a real number like we saw beforeã€‚

 or the square roots negative in which case we can factor out that negative and get an eye in the way we've just done nowã€‚

So this leads me to my definition of complex numbers the definition is that if you have two real numbers and here a real number are things like integers or fractions like 37 or irrational numbers like pi E and root2ã€‚

 all of those collectively are real numbersã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen a complex number is the symbol Z equals A plus IBã€‚

This is just defined to be the objectï¼Œ things that look like that like an A plus IBã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Often relabel them with shorthand as Zï¼Œ but either way those form complex numbersã€‚

I have some terminology around thisï¼Œ I call the A just the real component of it because it's just a real number by itselfã€‚

 and I call B the imaginary componentï¼Œ that's the portion multiplied by the eyeã€‚

So the point is that I define complex numbers in this way because this is the type of format we got when we saw the quadrait formulaã€‚

 it looked like sort of a real number plus an I times some other real numberã€‚

 so we're going to sort of abstract it away and define the complex numbers this wayã€‚

But now that I define them I have to define what other properties do they have so for example can you add to complex numbers Well we can do that I'm going to say that the addition of two complex numbers so an A plus an IB and then I add to that a C plus an ID the two real componentsã€‚

 the A and the C add together and give the new real component A plus B and the two imaginary components the B and the D add together and give the new imaginary component B plus B seems a very natural definition of addition to giveã€‚

All rightï¼Œ what about multiplicationï¼Œ so I've got an A plus an I and I now multiply it to a C plus an IDã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWellï¼Œ I'm going to imagine that my multiplication works sort of the same way it would if I had normal numbersã€‚

 I'm going to have things like the distributivity lawã€‚

 So if I have these two different terms and I multiply them togetherï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ what am I going to getã€‚

 we will define multiplication in such a way that it obeys the normal distributivity lawã€‚

 And then when you distribute these outï¼Œ wellï¼Œ you get AC plus Iad D plus IBC plus I squared times B Dã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNote here that I squared is minus1ï¼Œ so I can just take that i squared and replace it with a negative and then recombining things I get an AC minus BDã€‚

 that's my real component that's the stuff that doesn't have an eye and then thinks it has an I is an A plus BCã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo that is my definition of applicationã€‚Now I actually don't normally just memorize thisã€‚

 I just work at every time so if I have an exampleï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ I times2 plus Iã€‚

 well I distribute the I acrossï¼Œ this is going give me2 I plus I squaredã€‚

And then I squared is minus1ï¼Œ and so I can finally minus1 plus2 times Iã€‚

 this is the way I've written this in its standard form as a complex numberã€‚

Now addition multiplication are very familiar to us in other types of mathematical objects like the real numbersã€‚

 but there's one new operation that is a little bit different that we don't have ofï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 just the integers and this is called taking the complex conjugate it's another definition of another new operation that one can do on complex numbers the way we denote this is you take the a plus I and then you write a horizontal bar on top of itã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd then the way it's defined is that it just takes the imaginary component and makes it negativeã€‚

 so a plus IB conjugate is a minus IBã€‚The reason why this is so useful is that in the quadratic formula you get a plus or minus a square rootã€‚

 so it's useful to have some notation to talk about when you got the positive imaginary and the negative imaginary portion of thisã€‚

 so that's why we have this extra little bit of definitionã€‚

Now the way we defined complex numbers was we were looking at the quadratic formula and we were sort of looking at the answers to the quadratic formula to motivate our definition of complex numbersã€‚

 but what I want to observe here is that this actually works for any polynomial indeed one of the most powerful theorem in mathematics is called the fundamental theorem of algebra and basically what it says is that a degree n polynomial has exactly n roots So stepping to the language a bit more preciselyã€‚

 I start with a polynomial here where I write a sub n that's just a coefficient and then Z to the N Z instead of x here because I'm going imagine that my variables could be complex numbers and Z sort of the generic complex number where x is sort of the generic real number nevertheless if you have some polynomial that is of degree N what I mean by degree N is that its highest power is N or the way to say that is that A the coefficient of the highest power term is nonã€‚

Neverthelessï¼Œ you have this degree in polynomialã€‚And then you can factor that as wellï¼Œ Z minus N1ã€‚

 Z minus N2ï¼Œ Z minus Z3 and so forthã€‚So your rootsï¼Œ your solutionsã€‚

 the complex numbers that you can plug into that polynomial and get zero are there' Z1ï¼Œ the Z2ã€‚

 the Z3 what the theorem is really saying is there is anathm So if you have an n degree polynomialã€‚

 then you get N complex solutionsã€‚This is not the case with real numbersã€‚

 even that x squared equal to minus-1 that's a 32 polynomialï¼Œ but has no real solutionsã€‚ Okayã€‚

 let's see one example let me takeï¼Œ for instanceï¼Œ x cubed minus1 so not x squared now it's x cubed minus1 and I can factor this You can verify by multiplying it out if you wish that this is equal to x minus1 times x squared plus x plus1 I've factored this polynomial here I'm just choosing to use x because it's not initially presented as having complex solutions but we're going to see the complex solutions come out in a momentã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWellï¼Œ the one factor x minus1 is already written like the fundamental theorem of algebra says it should beã€‚

 it's already written as x minus something in this caseï¼Œ the number oneï¼Œ the real number oneã€‚

But x squared plus x equal plus oneï¼Œ that polynomialã€‚ Wellã€‚

 that's the polynomial we studied previouslyã€‚ We did the quadratic formula for that polynomialã€‚

 And what we got was two rootsã€‚ One root was one half plus I times root3 over 2ã€‚

 and the other one was its complex conjugateï¼Œ1 half minus I times root3 over 2ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So the point is I can factor this polynomial as x minus1ã€‚

 x minus the first complex root and x minus the conjugate of that complex rootã€‚

 so indeed this degree3 polynomial has three complex roots and is obeying the fundamental theor of algebraã€‚

Fundamental theorem of algebra is really niceã€‚ for instanceã€‚

 in my own PhD it's just simpler to always work over the complex numbers than it is to work over the real numbers because you can then employ theorems like this one and indeed this issue that if you only use real numbers then your polynomials don't have the full end solutions because all sorts of different problems and so if you just assume you're always working over the complex numbers things are just sort of easier to deal with Allright so that's our first introduction to sort of the algebraic side of complex numbers in the next video we're gonna to see how do I look at complex numbers geometrically Allright so if you enjoyed this videoã€‚
