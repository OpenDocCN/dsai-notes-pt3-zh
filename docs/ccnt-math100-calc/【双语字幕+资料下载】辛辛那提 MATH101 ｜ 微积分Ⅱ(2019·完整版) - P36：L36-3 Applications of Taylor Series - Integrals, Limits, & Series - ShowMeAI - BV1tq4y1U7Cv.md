# P36ï¼šL36-3 Applications of Taylor Series - Integrals, Limits, & Series - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Fã€‚In this videoï¼Œ we're going to talk about three different applications of Taylor seriesã€‚

 three different things from back in calculus 1 and calculus2 problems that either were challenging to do or that you couldn't do by the methods of calculus 1 and calculus 2ã€‚

 But now that we know Taylor seriesï¼Œ we can go back and do themã€‚ The first of theseã€‚

 I'm going to focus on is an integration problemã€‚ in particularã€‚

 consider the integral of E to the minus x squared Dxã€‚ And it's actually a very important integralã€‚

 This kind of distribution in probability in statistics is called a normal distributionã€‚

 It comes up all the timeã€‚ So the issue of doing integrals of this form are actually pretty importantã€‚

 But we don't know how to do that by the methods of calculus 1 or calculus 2ã€‚ can'tï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 do a U subï¼Œ it doesn't work outã€‚ if you'd want to try an integration by partsã€‚

 It's not going to be niceã€‚ In factï¼Œ it turns out that there isn't a nice answer in terms of functions like E to the X and polynomials and trigonometry and so onã€‚

But we can use seriesã€‚ So for exampleï¼Œ so for exampleã€‚

 we know that the Taylor series for e to the x is just this sum from0 to infinity of x to the n over n factorialã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ this is the Taylor series center about x equal to 0 nowã€‚This is E to the Xï¼Œ but in my inã€‚

 I have E to the minus x squaredã€‚ So let me just substitute that inã€‚ And everywhere I have a Xã€‚

 I'm going to replace it with a minus x squaredã€‚Nowï¼Œ I'm doing the integral of this thingã€‚

 So let me go and take the integral of both sides of these thingsã€‚ D Xã€‚

 And then I'm going to do one final just little bit of cleanup jobã€‚

 You see how I've got the minus x squared all to the power of nã€‚

 let me take the minus sign out of thatã€‚ And so if I transform thisã€‚

 what I'm going to have is a -1 to the nã€‚ and then an x to2 itã€‚Nowã€‚

 what I'm going to do with this Taylor series is I'm going to integrate it term by termã€‚ and that isã€‚

 in effectï¼Œ I'm integrating some constant times x to the2 nã€‚

 What happened to that X to the2 n will go to x to the two n plus1 divided by two n plus1ã€‚

 which is going to give me this particular seriesï¼Œ sum of-1 to the n over n factorialã€‚

 And then an x to the two n plus1 and then you divide out by the two n plus 1ã€‚ And finallyã€‚

 because it's an indefinite integralï¼Œ you have to add a plus Cã€‚

 So that's a perfectly acceptable answerï¼Œ we now have a power series answer to this integral of E to the minus x squaredã€‚

 If we wanted toï¼Œ we could give this collection a nameã€‚

 whatever you prefer we could call it after yourselfã€‚ If so whichã€‚

 The only reason it doesn't have a name is because as a group of mathematiciansã€‚

 we haven't ended up a green on oneï¼Œ the way we agreed on a name for the special functionã€‚

 E to the x and a special function sine of xã€‚ And then if I want toã€‚

 I can also do a definite integral hereã€‚ So everywhere I've got my indefiniteã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

I'm going to replace it with a zero up to oneï¼Œ indeed when I have my final seriesã€‚

 I evaluate it from zero up to oneã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒPlug in in 0 doesn't do anythingã€‚

 X to the 2 n plus 1 when x is 0 is just 0ã€‚ So that's all 0ã€‚ if I plug in oneã€‚

 the x portions are going to go awayã€‚1 to the 2 n plus 1 is 1ã€‚

 And that just leave me behind-1 to the n over the n factorial and over that 2 n plus1ã€‚

And this is a perfectly acceptable answerã€‚ if in your applicationã€‚

 you needed to approximate this integral as accurately as you so wishedã€‚ Wellã€‚

 you could go and take the first 10 or 100 or a million termsï¼Œ howeverã€‚

 many terms that you needed for your level of accuracyã€‚Allrightï¼Œ So that's an integration exampleã€‚

 Next upï¼Œ let's look at a limit exampleã€‚ So in this exampleï¼Œ I have an indeterminate formã€‚

 If I just plug in x equal to 0ï¼Œ I have 0 on the top and 0 on the bottomã€‚

 And what we learn back in calculus 1 is that in those scenariosï¼Œ you can do lopppi tas ruleã€‚

 In this caseï¼Œ you have to do it once and twiceã€‚ And Lopiital's rule often worksã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 it works in this particular exampleã€‚ But I'm gonna show you how I can do it with a Taylor seriesã€‚

 So in this expressionï¼Œ I've got this E to the x and the cosine of xã€‚

 And both of those have series expansionsï¼Œ which is to say if I go and plug them inã€‚

 So my x squared is still at the frontã€‚ But in place of E to the xã€‚

 I've put its series and in a place of cosine of xï¼Œ I've put its seriesã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Let me try to clean this up a little bitã€‚ So the numeratorã€‚

 I have an x squared multiplied by a whole seriesã€‚ So let me just put those togetherã€‚

 And in the denominatorï¼Œ I've got a plus1 and a -1ã€‚ Let's cancelã€‚ That isã€‚

 I'm going to have this expressionã€‚An x squared and higher order terms on the top and a minus x squared over 2 and higher order terms on the bottomã€‚

The fact that there's higher order terms here is important because I'm setting the limit as x goes to zeroã€‚

 so that means that every one of these terms is going to go to zeroã€‚

But the higher order terms go to 0 fasterã€‚ The x cubed goes to 0 faster than x squared doesã€‚

 The x to the fourth goes to 0 faster than x squared doesã€‚ So when I look at the top and the bottomã€‚

 I try to figure out what is going to dominate as x is going to go to 0ã€‚ Wellã€‚

 it's those lowest order ones that do it whenï¼Œ when x is being sent to 0ã€‚

 That is the things I really want to focus on is the first term on the top and the first term on the bottomã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo everything else is going to go to zero and is going to go zero in a way that is faster than theseã€‚

 but these two are going to cancel x squared over x squared cancels and it just leaves the coefficient1 over minus1 halfã€‚

 In other wordsï¼Œ this is equal to the value of minus2ã€‚So via this kind of analysisã€‚

 you're able to solve a whole class of limits that were challenging before as wellã€‚

 Final application for Taylor series is actually going to be series themselvesã€‚ Soï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 this is the Taylor series for E to the xï¼Œ the 1 over0 factorial plus x over1 factorialã€‚

 x squared over2 factorial plus x cubed over 3 factorial and so onã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWellã€‚

 what if instead I was giving you this problemï¼Œ this expression where there is no Xã€‚

 there's a lot of one's placesï¼Œ but it's just some particular seriesã€‚Nowã€‚

 if this was earlier on in calculus 2ï¼Œ we would have saidï¼Œ wellï¼Œ does it converge or divergeã€‚

 and you could have used a ratio test or maybe a comparison testï¼Œ There were a bunch of optionsã€‚

 but you would have deduced thatã€‚ yesï¼Œ it converges by some particular testã€‚

What does it converge to that was an open problem or at least would have been an open problem beforeï¼Ÿ

But nowï¼Œ if I look at this exampleï¼Œ this example is nothing but E to the X where I've plugged in x equal to 1 everywhereã€‚

 Those entire numerators are now all oneã€‚ That's me plugging in x equal to 1ã€‚So what is this seriesã€‚

 wellï¼Œ it's just whatever E to the one isï¼Œ that is it is Eã€‚Or if I slightly change things upã€‚

 if I consider the same basic exampleï¼Œ But I put some plus minus plus minus things againã€‚

 if we were doing a convergent testã€‚ Maybe you'd use ohã€‚

 I don't know the alternating series test in deduce that it convergeã€‚ But what did it converge2ã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ this thing is exactly E to the Xï¼Œ but I am plugging in not x equal to1 nowï¼Œ but x equal to-1ã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ for like the x and x cubed to x to the fifth and odd power termsã€‚

 putting in -1 is going to stick out a negativeã€‚ And for all the even power termsã€‚

 putting in 1 is not going to do anything is going to become positiveã€‚

 So this is just E to the power of -1 Aka 1 over Eã€‚ So in this videoã€‚

 we've seen these three different ways that I can apply Taylor series to problems from the past in our development of calculusã€‚
