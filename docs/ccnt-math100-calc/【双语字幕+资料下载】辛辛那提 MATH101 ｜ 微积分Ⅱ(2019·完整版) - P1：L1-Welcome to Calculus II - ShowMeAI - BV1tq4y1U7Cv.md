Calculus 1 is now over。 I'm sad。 I know you're sad。 baby is certainly sad。 Thankfully。

 Calculus 2 is right around the corner， and I want to give you a little bit of a preview of what we're going to be talking about。

First step， I wanted you to think about differentiation。

 If I gave you basically any composition or product or quotient or some of the functions that we know well。

 exponentials trimetric polynomials， youre able to compute the derivative of that。 In fact。

 it wasn't all that hard。 It was pretty straightforward。 but for integration。 It's not so simple。

 indeed， pretty simple integralgrams like the integral of X E to the X dx。

 we don't know how to do them， at least not by calculus1 method。

 So what we need to do is develop a whole bunch of new integration methods that try to widen the amount of integrals that were actually able to do。

 We're going to see， for example， that this X E to the X one can be done by a method called integration by parts。

 It sort of undoes the product rule in the same way that you substitution undid the chain rule。

 We'll see how to integrate things that are rational functions。

 a polynomial that talked about it by polynomial on the bottom。

 We're gonna to have a little bit of algebraic trickery called partial fractions。

 We're going to see how to integrate。😊，Intgrs that have a whole bunch of triometric terms。

 signs and cosines and so on。 We're going to have learn a whole bunch of these different integration methods。

 But what I like about integration is that It like differentiation。 integration。

 it isn't the case that we have an algebraic method for every type of integral。 In fact。

 there's all kinds of integrals that you and me and nobody else actually knows how to do at least not algebraically。

 And indeed， often when you're faced with an interesting integral。

 It's a little bit of sort of a crazy knot。 you don't know what to do。

 You supposed to make a substitution you try to try some method。

 You should to pick away at it until you get a creative idea。

 And then you're able to evaluate this integral。 Sometimes you can do that。 Sometimes you can。 Now。

 it gets a little bit interesting。 We've seen before that the integral from A to B was just the same thing as the area under a curve。

😊，But what if B was infinity， what if this was the area under the curve from some spot all the way off to infinity？

Well， it turns out that you can do these intervals and that they can sometimes actually be finite numbers。

 Yes， the area is going off。 You're always adding more and more area， but you're adding smaller。

 smaller， smaller amounts each time。 And sometimes that means that this improper integral where you're going off to infinity that it actually adds up to a finite value。

 which is pretty cool。 Now， I want you to take this curve。 I want you to rotate it around the X axis。

 We've seen that in calculus 1。😊，However， what we can do this time is not just compute the volume。

 but we can compute the surface area of some region of revolution。And in this particular case。

 this is something called Gabriel's horn in the instance of one of Xx。

 the surface area of this sort of infinite horn is infinite。But the volume。

 which we could do by our methods and calculus。 one， the volume is gonna turn out to be finite。

 which is pretty cool that you have this this sort of infinite region with an infinite surface area。

 but somehow a finite volume along the way of dual developinglo the surface area formula。

 we're also going be able to figure out how do I just compute the length of a curve。

 if I just take that curve between two values， imagine I've got a piece of string。

 And I stretch that piece of string out。 What is going to be the length of that curve。

 This is arc length， I will'll be able to answer that by integration too。 Now。

 for something completely different。 We're gonna to leave integration behind at least a little bit。😊。

I want you to imagine that I'm trying to get out of this room I've got here I've got the door and I could do this in a whole bunch of steps I can go from where I am halfway out。

And then I could go halfway out again， so half of a half is a quarter。

 and then I could go halfway out again so an eighth and then halfway out again， so it was 16th。

And then I want to get out of the room， there's really infinitely many steps every time I go from where I am to halfway the distance of the door and I keep on going on and on forever。

Clearly， I can get out of a room。 So what earth is going on here。

 It's the idea that the sum of a half and a quarter and an8 of the 16th and the 32nd and the 64th or a 1。

28 years keep on going down the line。 that infinite sum with infinitely many terms is not infinity。

It's one。 it's 100% of the way up to the door， which is a pretty cool thing that you can have these infinite sums。

 and sometimes like those improp renderdrals， sometimes they're going to converge to an actual value like one。

 Sometimes they will diverge to infinity。And if you can imagine an infinite sum being added up and we're going to have to develop a ton of different methods to test whether it converges。

 whether it diverges is going to be this whole project， but if I can imagine it for numbers。

 what if I added up， each sum was just say a polynomial， a different power of x。

 something like1 plus x plus x squared over2 plus x cubed over three times2 and so on。😡，Well。

 this thing is some function for every value of x。 you're going to get an infinite series。

 and then infinite series may or may not converge。 And it turns out this infinite series。

 this one plus x plus x squared over2 and so on。 this a very special series。 It does converge。

 In fact， for every possible value of x， it converges some series only converge from some values of x。

 not others， this converges for every single value of x。 and more importantly。

 this infinite sum is the same function as just E to the x。 indeed。

 one way to see that if you take term by term and you differentiate this series。 Well。

 the one goes to a0。 but then the x goes to a1 and the x squared over two goes to an x。😊。

Term by term， if you differentiate that series you get itself。

 But if you take the derivative of BDDx， you get itself as well。

 So that's some evidence to suggest that maybe these two things are't equal。 Indeed。

 we're going to see that they truly are equal。 And then all these functions that we've been seeing sine and cosine and exponential。

 We're gonna see that they all have the so-called Taylor series that are going to be some sort of this infinite sum of polynomials。

 and they're going to add up to these functions。 And you're gonna have to ask when can be this done。

 There is it only true for some value of X and not others。

 it's going to be a big project called Taylor series， but it's really， really， really powerful。

 particularly because if I want to approximate UDx。 Why I just sum up the first， say。

 three terms in its Taylor series， that's pretty simple like do that in the calculator。

 that's an approximate value for the exponential。😊。

We've seen before so-called Cartesian coordinates where I give you an x and a Y it sort of vertical and horizontal coordinate。

 but another completely different way to describe points on the plane to something called polar coordinates。

 And here what I'm going to do is to describe some point。

 I'm gonna tell you what the distance R is from the origin up to that point。

 and I'm going tell you what the angle theta from the x axis up to that particular line is going to be。

 And if I give you an R and a theta， you're going be able to plot this point。

 So then you're gonna to have these so-called polar curves are're going to do these things like r equals cosine of two theta and it's gonna to be some curve that exists on the plane given in polar coordinates。

 if I plug in theta equal to pi over4 then my cosine is going be equal to0 And so if I try to plow this point is it's going to start at one and then as I rotate my theta around it's going to get smaller and smaller down to zero and then I can just continue sketch here and I get this really pretty looking row things。

 So if that's polar coordinates and then final thing we're gonna look at。

I the idea of vectors no vectors are used all the time in physics and engineering and many of the other subjects and one way you can think about is gravity if I have the earth。

At every point in space in our solar system， we have a sort of gravity force vector and what it does is it points in the direction that gravity would take me and it hast sort of an arrow it it tells me which direction we're going you can see that all the right around the surface of the earth it's always pointing more or less to the center of the Earth。

And then if I go further away， yes， it still points to the center of the earth。

 I'm ignoring the sign of the moon for a little bit here， but because we're further away。

 the force of gravity is small， so its magnitude is less。

 And so I indicate this by the same arrow showing as direction。

 but the length of the arrow is a little bit shorter。 That's what vectors are。

 the things with the magnitude and a direction they're used all the time we're going to study these and see how we can solve problems using vectors。

So that's calculus too and I know I'm excited I know you're excited baby is certainly excited and the good news here is that I already have a calculus 2 playlist ready for you so you can go and integrate that subscribe button and really integrate the subscribe button I'm trying to have my YouTube moment Give me back my baby。
