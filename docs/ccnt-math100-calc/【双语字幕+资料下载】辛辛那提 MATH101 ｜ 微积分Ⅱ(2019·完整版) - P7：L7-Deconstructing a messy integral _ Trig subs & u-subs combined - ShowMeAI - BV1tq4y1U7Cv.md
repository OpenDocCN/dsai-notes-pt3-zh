So far in our calculus to exploration of integration strategies， we've seen integration by parts。

 integration by trigonometric identities and integration by trigonnometric substitution。 Now。

 in this video， I've given a particular integral that looks really。

 really messy in this one we're going to have to tease it out and I'd actually encourage you to pause the video and to see whether you can come up with an answer to this particular integral yourself。

😊，Now when I look at this， when I try to tease out what could be a strategy。

 how could I choose an effective strategy the first thing Id like to do is sometimes a bit of a process of elimination when I think about could I use a triggotometric identity I because lots' of trig terms。

 maybe a trig identity is the thing to do。😡，But if I think about the obvious ones， like， for example。

 Pythagoras， Well， in the denominator， it doesn't quite work out。 There's sort of a weird for there。

 Even if I took that sign to the fourth and expanded it， nothing' is going to cancel very nicely。

 I could take that s co term and make it one half of sine2 theta。 That's another identity。

 But the most obvious identities， None of them really work out。

 It's also not obviously the case that integration by parts is all that helpful。

 if If I think through a couple different ways that might try to split up this integral。

 none of them seem to work in terms of setting a U and setting it a D。However。

 there's one glimmer of hope here， which is that if I think about trigometric substitution。

 trigometric substitution had a whole bunch to do with things where you had like square roots plus one or minus1。

 and I sort of have that here， I've got this of the power of three/haps， I have this minus one。

 maybe if I do a bit of massaging first， a bit of substitution first。

 I can make it an integral where I can use a trigometric substitution。😡。

Now there's a couple of choices here what about u equal to sine of theta。

 there's certainly a lot of sine of theta it be a u of the fourth from the bottom， a U on the top。

 the cosine would become the D。But then I still have a u to the fourth on the bottom。

 it's not quite right for trignometric substitution we want like a U squared on the bottom。

So what if instead I do this， I will set my u to be equal to twice sine squared of theta。😡。

Then my DU is going to be four times sine of theta， cosine of theta。

 and if I go and take all of that and plug it in， well。

 because of the four stick in there you get a one quarter out the front。

 and then it's just a DU over u squared minus1 the power of three/2als。

So with a little bit of anticipation， we've chosen a substitution。

 a U substitution that puts the integral into a standard form where I can then go and do a trig substitution。

 things like u squared minus1 are screaming to have a trig substitution well with one makes sense if we just focus on this particular integral。

Now you might recall that we have these different Pythagorean identities。

 there was the sine squared plus co squared equals 1。

 you could divide out by co squared and get 10 squared plus1 is seccanN squared。

Because my integralgra here is at U squared minus-1。 it's something squared -1。

 I think the bottom of the two integrals makes more sense because you can take the one to the other side。

 you get Ccan squared minus-1， you can replace that all with1 squared。 So let's do Cant。

 That's going to be why my trig substitution。 U is Cant of theta。You， of course。

 are allowed to go to that chart I've shown before for how to come up with a trimetric substitution。

 but I think it's better if you think it through and think through the identity that you're going to use to realize it's going to be best a C end of the。

Nonetheless， given that we've chosen CKNF theta， that means our DU is going to be CKNF theta tangent of theta d theta。

 and then the final thing that we need to figure out is the restriction on the domain。😡。

Let's go and plug this in for our substitution We have this U we're plugging in secant and what do we get the one quarter of secant tangent d theta on the top and then secN squared minus1 to the power of three/ halfals on the bottom。

Now we can use Pythagoras。 We have the 10 squared plus one is seccan squared formula。

 You rearrange it。 seccan squared minus1 is 10 squared。

 so I can just go and put a10 cubed on the bottom10 squared square rooted is tan0 and then cubed is 10 cubed。

 By the way， it was right at this step where we did that business of the restriction of the domain。

 I had chosen a domain where tangent was always positive so I could go and put this in and end up with this positive tangent all cubed。

😊，Now there's a tan on the top， there's tan on the bottom， we can cancel that。

 that's just going to be secant over tan0 squared d theta。AndNow this is a triometric integral。

 We have to use trig idities to try to solve this。 Now， at this point in the calculation。

 I went and paused and tried to do something with this seccan over tan squared。

 maybe put it a pythagoras。 and nothing was jumping out at me immediately working with secs and tans。

 which do often play nicely together。 it wasn't immediately always， it was a good path forward。

 So what I'm actually going to do when I focus on this is I've got the sec n in the tan。

 and I color coded them for you。 is I'm going to convert back to ss and cosines。

 That is the secN is one over cosine。 The tangent is sine over co， but because it's on the bottom。

 I can flip it。 So it's cos squared over sine squared。 this is a good strategy。

 if the sec and tangents aren't obviously working you could always convert back to ss and cosines regardless。

 now that I written it in terms of signs and cosines， I see there's a canceling of the cosine。

 And so I can rewrite this as cos over sine squared。

 Now that we have this in a nice form with signs and cosines。😊，I can do a substitution。

 but I'm going to call it a W substitution because I already did a U substitution earlier on it's the same sort of idea。

 but I'm just going to call it W。 So I understand W is sine of theta and of course Dw is cosine of theta D theta。

 And then when I plug that in， I'm going to get the one quarter。

 the integral of the DW over W squared。 This is just the power rule so we're gonna say it's minus1 over 4 W plus the C as is an indefinite interval Are we done。

Sadly not quite because I've done a W substitution， I've done a trig substitution。

 I've done a U substitution， I've done three substitutions， and now I've got it in terms of W。

 I want to go all the way back to the beginning to get it in terms of x as my original integral was written down in so I have to undo these three different substitutions most reason of them was W so I've got a W here and I'm going to rewrite it in terms of theta this is now minus one quarter sine theta plus C。

That's some progress I now need to go and undo the trigoometric substitution That one's a little bit harder。

 You might remember there's a bit of a rigmarole for dealing with that in particular。

 the substitution we had done was that you was Ccan of theta that's what my trig substitution was。😡。

And I can come up with a little bit of a triangle for that， so if I make a triangle。

 like right triangle with an angle of theta down here， then what I am saying is that secN of theta。

 which is the same thing as one over cosine of theta。

 so one over cosine of theta is going to be this value of U so because cosine is going to be the adjacent over the hypotenus that I'm doing secN which is the opposite that if I make my hypoten is a u and my adjacent to1 then indeed secN of theta is just U。

😡，And now that I have two sides， I can get the third by Pythagoras。

 I can say that the opposite is the square root of u squared -1。 and now I can plug it in。

 what sine theta is going to be the opposite square root of u squared1 divided by the hypotting U。

 which is a u It's on the bottom。 So I flip it。 And what do I get minus u over4。

 the square root of U squared-1 plus C。 And I am still not done because even though I've done the trigonometric。

 I you recall all the way at the back at the beginning， we did an initial U substitution。

 the related u and x， it was u is this twice sine squared of x。 I plug that in。

 What do I get-2 sine squared of x all divided by4 square root of4 sine to the4 the x of1 plus C。

 that is a mouthful， but it is indeed our final answer。😊。

So my advice to you when you see sort of a messy integral that doesn't have an obvious step is just to play around to it。

 Don't get married to your first choice， your first use substitution or your first strategy。

 try to anticipate what might work， the big thing for us here with I was anticipating a trigoometric substitution you don't think about well could it be a trig sub it's very hard to ever get that right answer so have those in your mind have that alarm bell going off when you see that square root and that blot of the power of fourth minus-1 can you make it something squared minus-1 instead have those alarm bells going off in your head be looking for them。

 but broadly just be willing to play around an experiment as you go through your process of trying to solve an integral。

Now， if I go back to this chart that we've seen before for how to put in what type of substitution in that seccanant case that we're using here。

 you'll notice that the restriction of the domain is kind of weird。

 So let me take a brief of to explain where that restriction on that domain came from。

 We haven't yet done secantant。 Well， to do this， I first want to see a graph of secant secant if one over cosine。

 So what I would do is graph cosine and secant in the yellow， I'm going to have cosine。

 And then for seccanant， what you do is this one over cosine。 So， for example。

 at pi over2 cosine was0。 So one over cosine， which is what secant is that pi over2 is going to be a vertical laymptde indeed。

 we get a verticalrg bassymptome。 And you can sort of go through the other points you get this graph in the pink。

 this is just going to be our secant if theta。Now for a restriction or domain。

 the consideration we want is some restriction where every value of Cant is attained and attained only once so we want every value it looks like from one up to infinity and minus infinity up to minus1 C doesn't take any value between minus1 and1 that's okay。

Now， there's a lot of repetition here because it's periodic。

 but we want to choose some restriction and I want to think cleverly about how to do this。

If I look at the Pythagre formula I'm going to use。

 I'm going to eventually use CkN squared minus1 is 10 squared。When I plug it in up here。

 I'm going to have a square root there because of the power to the three/2s。

 So I'm going to have a tan squared square rooted， which I want to write is just tangent。

 but I could only do that if tan is all positive。 If tan0 is sometimes positive and sometimes negative in the region that I restrict to。

 then I'm can have to break it up into different cases， some with positive signs。

 some with negative signs， I don't want to do it。😊。

So even though I'm trying to figure out a restriction on the graph of CAN and I put up the graph of CAN。

 let me take a look for a moment at the graph of tangent， which is this。Kangent is periodic。

 and I notice that it is positive between zero and pi over2。

And then it is a g positive between pi and3 pi over2。 But it was negative in the middle。

 It was negative between pi over2 and pi。 So let's keep that in our mind。

 This is where tangent is positive。 So if I now want to make a restriction on the domain of seccan going back to seccan。

 Look what I've highlighted in green。 The0 to pi over2。

 and the pi to three pi over  two in those regions in these green regions。

 tangent would be positive everywhere。 so I could do this square root of the square business and just make it equal to positive。

 I wouldn't be making any mistake。😊，But I have indeed satisfied the conditions of it hits every single value of C it hits it only once。

 so that's how we come up with this particular weird restriction that our thetas are in between zero and pi over 2 and then between pi and 3 pi over  two。
