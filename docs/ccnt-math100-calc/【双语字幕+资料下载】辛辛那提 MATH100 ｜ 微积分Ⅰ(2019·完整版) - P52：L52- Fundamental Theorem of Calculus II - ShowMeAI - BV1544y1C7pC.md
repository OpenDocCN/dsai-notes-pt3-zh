In this video， we're going to investigate the fundamental theorem of calculus number2。

 When we looked at the fundamental theorem of calculus number one。

 we investigated the derivative of the accumulation function。

 the derivative of some particular integral。 And we saw how that worked。 And in this video。

 we're going to go the other way around。 we're going to take， in some sense。

 the integral of a derivative。😊，So let me consider just the integral from A to B。

 a definite integral from a to B of F of x dx。Now， this had a particular geometric meaning。

 We saw that that was the area under the curve。 And， in fact， we had defined what this was。

 It was kind of a messy thing。 We would define it to be this limit of this sum of these little rectangles。

 We had a whole process for that。 But one of the things that came up is that computing integrals from the definition was kind of hard。

 even for really simple functions going the form way took a lot of effort。

 So we want to have a tool that allows us to do these， All us to compute these areas much， much。

 much easier。 And fundamental theorem calculus。 Numb two is the answer。

 So how are we going to do this。😊，What I want to begin with is I want to imagine。

 I've got this little F here。 I want you to imagine that you have an anti derivative of it。 That is。

 I want you to imagine that you have some function capital F of x， where the derivative of capital F。

Is little F。Now， why is that important， Because if you have such an anti derivative capital F。

 then the statement of the fundamental theor of calculus 2 is that this particular defite integral is just going to be the big F at the value of B minus the big F at the value of a。

 And that is going to be our fundamental theorem of calculus。

So what really is going on here when I look at this little F， I'm saying， well， look。

 the lowercase F is the derivative of something。 And then what we're saying here is that the integral of the derivative of something is just back at the original level of the function。

 Or level of F of x， except if it's a definite integral。 I'm going for a to B。

 I have to take the quotcious， that function capital F at B minus that function capital F at the value of a。

So while this theorem is investigating the interval of a derivative of the first fundamental theor of calculus。

 it investigated the derivative of an interval。 Alright。

 so let's see how this plays out in the specific example of the definite interval from one to2 of S squared dx。

😊，First thing I need to do is find an anti derivative。 Well。

 what about about this particular function here where I'm saying x cubed over3。

 And I can verify that the derivative of that by the power rule is 3 x squared divided by3。

 the threes can So that I'm just left with that squared。 So that's not so bad。 I have this。

 and that's going to be my anti derivative。 Now， what is fundamental theor calculus。

 say it says it's just the antid at the value of two minus the anti derivative the value of one。

 I can compute those that's two cubed over 3 minus-1 cubed over 3。 Now。

 I could give you a different function in a different interval。

 But as long as you can give me an anti derivative。

 The fundamental theor of calculus is going to make computing all these definite integrals really easy。

 just a matter of substitution。 So the goal of finding anti derivatives。

 that's really the big challenge when it comes to definite integration。😊，Now。

 the final point I want to make when I think about the first fundamental theorem callus。

 the second fundamental theorem of calculus is that there is actually three different types of objects。

 types of mathematicalematic objects that are similar that have integral signs that are related。

 but are all slightly different。For example， if I have the so called indefinite interval。

 this is the one where I don't give any limits of integration。😡，Well， the outcome of this。

 something like x cubed over 3 plus C。 This is what we call a family of functions。

 which is to say for every value of C， you get a slightly different function。

 There's a whole family of them for every C。 you get a different function。😊。

I could also consider the accumulation function。 Those were the subjects of the first fundamental theor of calculus。

 And here， the accumulation function integral from a up to x of some T squared Dt。 But what's that。

That is a function of X。 It's not a family of functions， no plus C any longer。

 but for every value of X， you get an output， you get a number， you get the area。 So it's a function。

 Every input gives you an output。And then finally， for a definite integral。

 this is what we get out of the fundamental theorem of calculus number2。 this integral from a to B。

 where I specify both bounds。 And here I actually get a value。 This thing is a number。

 It's just the anti derivative at B， whatever number， that is minus the anti derivative at a。

 whatever number that is。 So as you go through the fundamental theorems of calculus and you're playing around with integrations。

 always click clear in your mind。 Are you computing a number。

 Are you computing a function or are you computing a family of functions。😊。
