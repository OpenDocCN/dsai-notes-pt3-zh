I want to try to illustrate to you a little bit of how the chain rule works graphically。

What I have is two functions， the first is this parabola F of x。

And the second is going to be this function h of x， that's a composition， it's f of 2 x。

And what taking F of 2x does is it horizontally compresses the function F of x。

 so the sort of wider bottom parabola gets compressed down into this narrow parabola F of 2x。

And indeed， I might note here that this f of 2 x here that really what you have going on is some inside function that I could call G。

 and my G is just equal to the function2 x。 So in other words。

 what you have is a composition F of G is going to be this particular function H of x。😡。

So before we look at what happens graphically， let's just compute this out algebraically。

 That is if I want to figure out what the derivative of H is。

 so if I want to figure out what h prime of x is， we use the chain rule and the chain rule says first。

😡，Drrow to the outside， which is they're going to be the function F， so it's going to be the f prime。

At the inside。 So F prime at the value of 2 x drew to the outside， at the inside。

 and then I need to do that final point where I multiply by the derivative of the inside。

But the inside function here is just going to be this two x。

So I'm multiplying by the derivative of 2x， the derivative of 2x is just 2。

 so what I'm multiplying by is just 2。So in other words。

 what we're saying here is that the derivative of H is just like the D to of F。

 but there's this sort of horizontal compression factor， the 2 x of the inside。

 and then there's also another two that's multiplied on the outside which is kind of interesting。

So let's see how this works。First of all， I want to focus on where my F and my G have horizontal tangent lines but they have zero derivatives。

 so we can notice those two points， the one here is occurring at a half。

 that's when this h of x is going to have the derivative of zero， a horizontal tangent line。

 but for the F it doesn't occur over here at the value of one。

 that's when it has a deron of0 or a horizontal tangent line。😡。

So let's see if that actually makes sense， I'm going to plug in some specific values here。

 I want to look at h prime of 0。5 here， and what it tells me is I want to look at F prime of twice a half。

 so in other words， f prime of1 multiplied by the value of two。😡。

But F prime of1 we just said was equal to zero and so that's equal to zero So my formula seems to be pretty good so far it says the derivative of a half is just by chain rule the F prime of1 times2 so I get zero and everything works out I get exactly what I anticipated。

Allright， that was lovely。 Let's try just another point to see whether the formula still makes sense。

 Now notice that there's these these two pieces to this formula because it's the product of two things。

The first part is saying the derivative h is just like the derivative of F but not at the same point。

 it slides where the point occurs， it goes from the derivative at a half is well you look to the derivative at one and then you multiply it by two So here to figure out the derivative down here of V H what I did with I looked at the derivative of the f at twice a it at one and then I multiply it by  two and in this example the multiplication by two doesn't do much because it's just taking a zero and multiply it by  two I get another zero。

But let me look at a different point， let me look at what happens at one。

 so I've got put in my two different tangent lines。

And then what we say is that if I want to look at this tangent line。

 what I do is I look over here at F prime at twice the point， so instead of looking at one。

 I come over here at F and I look at the value of two， what is F prime at 2？😡。

But if you'll notice that the slopes have also changed。

 this is a little flatter and that's a little steeper and that's because of this multiplication by 2。

 So when I'm figurediguring out the derivativeo of H。

 I both look to the derivativeruo of F at twice the point in this case going over to2 xon x。

But I also multiply it slope by two， so as we come here you get this multiplication by two and this slope is steeper by a factor of two than that one is。

Now this is admittedly a relatively straightforward example only because the inside function。

 the G of x is equal to 2 x， which is a relatively simple function。

But if I had a really complicated F and a really complicated G， the same idea sort of works。

 which is that to figure out the derivative of a composition。

 you look to the derivative of the outside function evaluated at wherever the inside function is going to take you。

 but then you multiply by this sort of modulating factor， the two in this case。

 or generically the derivative of the inside， and so you have this product of these two different things。

😡。
