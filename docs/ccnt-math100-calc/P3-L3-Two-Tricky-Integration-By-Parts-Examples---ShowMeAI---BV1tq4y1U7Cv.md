# P3ï¼šL3-Two Tricky Integration By Parts Examples - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to see two slightly trickier examples of integration by partsã€‚

 The first of them is going to be thisã€‚ We've got the integral of x to the 7 times the square root of this one plus x to the fourth D Xã€‚

 Ive put down here the integration by parts formula at the bottomã€‚ So we need to find a Uã€‚

 we need to find a D Vã€‚ Nowï¼Œ because of the productã€‚

 the most natural first guess might have been to sayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ U is x to the 7ã€‚

 And D V is this square root of 1 plus x to the fourth D X businessã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒBut if you did thatï¼Œ wellã€‚

 you can take the derivative of x to the seventh and get7 x to the sixthã€‚

It'd be very hard to take the anti derivative of the square root of one plus x to the fourthã€‚

 If you were trying to integrate just the square root of one plus x to the fourthã€‚

 maybe you would set the inside of the square root to be sort of sayï¼Œ a U and a U substitutionã€‚

 You'd be missing the D Uï¼Œ you wouldn't have a 4 x cubed termã€‚

 And then if I decided to go the other way aroundã€‚ And I set my U to be the square root businessã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ its derivative would have a b to the power of -1 halfã€‚ There'd be stuff on the bottomã€‚

 We just keep on getting more complicatedã€‚ So what can I doã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWhen I look at this x to the seventhã€‚

 I can think that I can break that X to the seventhã€‚ So for exampleã€‚

 let me take the x to the seventh and write it as x to the fourth times x to the power of threeã€‚

 we know that if you multiply two things with the same baseã€‚

 their exponents add together to become x to the seventhã€‚Nowã€‚

 the reason why I do this is that if I thought about trying to tie an anti derivative to that square root of one plus x to the fourthã€‚

 the thing that was missing was you needed a D U where the U is the insideã€‚

 the one plus X to the fourthã€‚ You are missingã€‚ That is an X cubed termã€‚ But when I split this upã€‚

 I could sayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ lookï¼Œ the x cubed term is going to be part of the integrating out of the square root businessã€‚

 That leaves behind an x to the fourthã€‚ that can be my Uã€‚

 where now I'm talking about the U in integration by partsã€‚ So let's do thatã€‚

 let's set my U to be X to the fourthã€‚ and my Dv is everything else that remains the X cubedã€‚

 the square root of the one plus x to the fourth and the D Xã€‚

 if I go and put those up on the side hereã€‚ Okayï¼Œ well taking the derivative of the U is pretty straightforwardã€‚

 that's just going to be4 x cubed D Xã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNowï¼Œ the integral of this Dv is a little bit trickier here because this is a U substitutionã€‚

 So you might have to go off on the side and do that computationã€‚

 You might have to remind yourss how to do a U substitutionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

But the basic plan that I'm going to do is I'm going to go and I'm going take inside of thisã€‚

 So that's this one plus x to the fourthã€‚ I'm going to set that to be my Uã€‚

 And now I'm talking about the u of u substitutionã€‚ not the U in this integration by parts formulaã€‚

 If you prefer you call it W substitution will call this a W doesn't matterã€‚ regardlessã€‚

 whatever name you give to the inside the one plus X to the fourthã€‚

 If I look at the things that are on the outside the x cubed and the Dxã€‚ Wellã€‚

 that is exactly what I need except for a factor of4ã€‚ the derivative of the inside is4 x cubed Dxã€‚

 and I only have an X cubed Dxã€‚ So when I go and do my u substitutionã€‚

 What I'm going to get is that my V is going to be one corner because I was off by the fourthã€‚

 then the square rootï¼Œ which is b of the power of one half becomes b of the power of three halfã€‚

 and then you divide out by the three half Aka multiplying by the two thirdsã€‚

 And so that's going to be my anti derivative of my Vã€‚ Wellã€‚

 now that I've done that little U substitutionï¼Œ I can go andã€‚Figure out I've got my U hereã€‚

 I've got my V for the integration of my parts formulaã€‚ I can go and put them all inã€‚

 and this is what I'm going to be gettingã€‚ Nowï¼Œ this is some progressã€‚

 but I still have one more integral that I have to doã€‚ I have to do this integral now of 1ï¼Œ6ã€‚

 That wasï¼Œ by the wayï¼Œ the one quarter times at two thirdã€‚

And then I have this thing to the power of 3/ halfã€‚ So then I also have a4 x cube floating aroundã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ how do I do thatï¼Œ This is againï¼Œ another U substitutionã€‚ You think rememberã€‚

 how do I do U substitutionï¼Œ Keep saying U substitutionã€‚ But when I say U substitutionã€‚

 I don't mean the integration by parts Uã€‚ It's this own thingã€‚ I will call it W substitutionã€‚

 regardlessï¼Œ how am I going to deal with thisã€‚ Wellï¼Œ againï¼Œ it is a b to the power of3/ halfã€‚

 So let's set that to be my sort of inside this one plus F to the fourthã€‚

When you take the derivative of that insideï¼Œ you get 4 x cubedã€‚

 and you'll notice that that occurs right there in my integralã€‚ I have a 4 x cubedã€‚

 And there's a 16 out the frontã€‚ So I can go and do this integralã€‚ And what am I going to get the 1ã€‚

6ã€‚The b of the three has goes to b to the five/ hals divided out by five halfs A K multiply by two fifthsã€‚

 And then finallyï¼Œ I have to remember to add the plus C because I'm doing an indefinite integralã€‚

 So integration by parts did itã€‚ So I think the thing to take away from thisã€‚

 the sort of lesson of this example is that don't always just go and and apply integration by parts blindly where you say the thing on the left is the U and thing on the right as my Dã€‚

 you might have to break it up in a bit of a cleverer wayï¼Œ you mightï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ have to sayã€‚

 what do I need to be able to do a U substitutionï¼Œ I'll pull out as many xs as I need to be able to do my U substitutionã€‚

 and then I'm off to the races in the normal wayã€‚ All rightï¼Œ next exampleï¼Œ in this oneã€‚

 It starts pretty easy looking and E the x times cosine of xã€‚

 And when I'm thinking about what you in my Uï¼Œ which should my D Vã€‚

 it really doesn't matter all that muchã€‚ Okayï¼Œ taking the derivative or the anti derivative E to the X is just itselfã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒCosineï¼Œ whether you take the derivative or the antidï¼Œ it goes to a sineã€‚

 It just depends on what the minus sign is gonna beã€‚

 but it keeps on going between sine co sine co sine cos just with different sine as you go alongã€‚

 So it doesn't really matterã€‚ So how would I go and say that the U is going to be the E the X and then my Dv is going to be equal to the cos X D Xã€‚

 Let's run with that version of itã€‚ on the sideï¼Œ U is equal to the X V is equal to the cos of x D Xã€‚

 The derivative of E the X is just going to be E to the X d Xã€‚

 And the anti derivative of cosine of x dx is just going to be equal to the sine of xã€‚

 So V is sine xã€‚ And so we plug it inï¼Œ and we get this from the integration by parts formulaã€‚

 But the question isï¼Œ have I made my life any betterã€‚ Wellï¼Œ this integral that we have hereã€‚

 this E to the X sine of xï¼Œ This is not what I immediately know how to doã€‚ In factã€‚

 this E to the X sine of x kind of looks like the beginningï¼Œ E to the Xã€‚

 Cosine of x in terms of it level of difficultyã€‚ So if I clean this up a little bitã€‚

 Let me just focus just onã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒThat e the x sine of xã€‚Nowï¼Œ it's the second kind of thingã€‚

 I think I could do integration by parts to thatã€‚ So let me just tryã€‚

 let's do another integration by parts just on this green stuff here and see what happensã€‚

 So I'm going to go and set my u equal to e to the Xï¼Œ I'm going to set my Dv equal to the sine of xã€‚

 I'm going to go and write that downã€‚ I'm going to find my D U is the E to the x d X and my V when I take the anti is minus cosine of xã€‚

 Allrightã€‚So I have thatï¼Œ and if I want to plug this into the integration required parts formulaã€‚

 so the first thingï¼Œ the original E the X side of Xï¼Œ that doesn't changeï¼Œ that's just thereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then I subtract offï¼Œ I had to put brackets around itã€‚ I subtracted off this relatively big thingã€‚

 that's integration by parts the second time now applied over hereã€‚Okayï¼Œ this is goodã€‚

 because now what I haveã€‚ If I look carefully is in thisã€‚ it's a third integralã€‚

 and it says E to the x cosine of xã€‚ And you might think well hold onã€‚

 that's just as difficult as it was at the beginningã€‚ but hold onã€‚

 it is exactly what we had at the beginning in effectã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 this E to the x cosine of x integral is the same thing as the E to the x cosine integral all the way back at the beginningã€‚

 They're the same thingã€‚ So what we really have is this E to the x term is equal to a bunch of other stuffã€‚

 And then subtract it off another E to the x termã€‚ So I'm gonna move it back on the other side and I'm gonna to get twice the integral of E to the x cosine x equal to this E to the x sine x plus E to the x cosine of xã€‚

 And then finallyï¼Œ I'm gonna to take the twoï¼Œ when I'm gonna move it overã€‚

 So my final answer is integral of E to the x cosine x is one half nowã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Times this E D the x sine x plus E the X cosine effectsã€‚

 So those are two different examples of integration by partsã€‚

 I cannot possibly exhaust all the different possibilitiesã€‚

 but the lesson I would give to you is to just play around with thingsã€‚ Try an integration by partsã€‚

 If it doesn't seem like it's going somewhereï¼Œ try to break it up a bit of a different wayã€‚

 go a step furtherï¼Œ see what you can do is a little bit of an art form to try to figure out what is a good way to break out an integral to do an integration by partsã€‚

 And heckï¼Œ a lot of the time integration by parts isn't even the right methodã€‚

 But that's what we're doing and play around with right nowã€‚
