In this video， we're going to see a second example of integration by trigoometric substitution。

 But there's a couple things that are going to change。

 And the first of them is that this is an indefinite integral。

 The previous one was a definfinite integral and that we saw that there is a way to change limits of integration。

 Now， actually， an indefinite integral turns out to be a little bit harder for reasons we're going to get into it in a moment。

 The second thing we really want to focus in on is how do we choose， How do we make the choice。

 How do we articulate a strategy for what substitution to make Now。

 what we have here is one over x squared plus4 all squared。😊，Now。

 one of the things I want to remind you about is that we have these pythagorean identities。

 The sine squared plus co squared is1。 If you divide out by co squared。

 you get 10 squared plus one is sec n squared。 and there's a third one。

 but we actually usually never need to use it for trimetric substitution。 These two are enough。 Now。

 how do I know which of these I'm supposed to use。 Notice how I have x squared plus 4。 Okay。

 that's not exactly as nice as x squared plus 1， there's that four there。

 I have to figure out how to deal with it。 But if I look down here at the examples。

 I do see then one that says 10 squared plus1。 As in if I made my x equal to tangent。

 It look like something squared plus some positive value。

 So I kind of feel like the bottom one might work out。 If I look at the top one。

 it would always be like one minus sine squared or1 minus cosine。 The sine doesn't work out。😊。

And the other thing to decide on， I've decided on using the second equation is， well。

 it's not plus one， it's plus four here。But what if I do the following。

 what if I said x is equal to twice tangent of theta？When you square the x。

 you get four tangent of theta， there's a four where the x is going to be。 and there's a plus 4。

 the  four is can come out。 And then it's just going to leave behind1 squared plus 1。

 So that's how I sort of anticipate。 That's how I think forward to what is a good substitution to make。

 I want to decide which of these different equations to use。

 And I'll use the one that's compatible with the s like the pluses or the minuses。

 And then I make the coefficient adjusted to whatever I need that to be。 Okay。😊。

If that is my X then my Dx is just the derivative of this。 So two Cant squared of theta D theta。Now。

 I have put up here the graph of tangent of theta。 Now， tangent of theta is a periodic function。

 So it repeats many times。 And if I ask， for example， if tan theta is equal to a value like， say one。

 what value of theta is that well， the answer is there's infinitely many。 So as I did previously。

 I want to make a so called restriction of the domain。

 I want to choose one of these branches that is one to one。

 And if I select this green region here between the minus power 2 and the pi over 2。

 It hits every possible value that tan could hit between minus infinity to infinity。

 and it hits it exactly once there's no repeats。 So I'm going to make that an additional restriction。

 I'm going to demand that my value of theta is between minus power 2 and pi 2。Now， this choice。

 this analysis of what substitution I should do， the choice of making it， the two。

 the restriction on the domain， all of that， we sort of came up with it。

 thinking about what would be reasonable。 But if you want。

 you can always go to this chart that I've shown previously。 And in this chart， you can see that。

 well， we had an x squared plus 4 looks most similar to the a squared plus accident tells you what the substitution is and tells you what the restriction。

 Although myself， I think it's better to think it through。

 anticipate the trigoometric identity you're going to use， Think about what the domain up to be。

 Nevertheless， we have this substitution。 so let's go and use it， let's plug these values into it。

 So what do I get on the top is the2 c squared of theta d theta。

 That's what my Dx became on the bottom，2 tangent of theta all squared plus4。

 and then all squared I can do some stuff I'm gonna to pull out all of my constants。

 And for that 10 squared plus one that remains when I factor wrote the four。 The1 squared plus one。

I'm going to go and use my identity and I'm going to put in secant squared。

 so what do I get two over 16， the secN squared on the top and then I get a sec to the power of four on the bottom secant squared and then squared again sec to the fourth。

😡，Allright， this is just a tri integral。 So let's just solve it。 Like it's a tri identical。

 It's one/ eighth。 And then that looks like the integral of one over sec can'ant squared。

 one over secant squared is just the same thing as cosine of squared。

 cosine of squared we can use the half angle identity on that's going to look like this is going to be a one half1 plus rather cosine of2 theta。

 And then I can integrate that。 The one8 out the front。 the one half goes to a theta over a half。

 And the co2 theta is going to go to one half sine2 theta plus C。😊，Now， are we done。 Well。

 not quite because the original integral was in terms of x， correct？

 But now we have an integral in terms of theta。 So what we really want to do is transform this from thetas back into x。

Now， before I go and do this substitution back， I'm going to take one quick look at the sine 2 theta term here。

 And I'm just going apply one trig identity。 I'll tell you why I'm doing this in a moment。

 just going to make my life a little bit easier。 I can apply something called a double angle identity。

 It says sine 2 theta is twice sine theta Co theta。 So I've just taken this little pink portion。

 I've done a trig identity。 I just wanted to sign a theta by itself and cos of theta by itself。

 I didn't want to have to mess around with this multi by two to sine of2 theta nonsense。😊。

Nonetheless， how do we take this integral and we're going to focus on transforming it back in terms of x。

 Now， our substitution was x is twice tangent of theta。😡。

And so you might think if I want to go the other way around。

 I should just take arc tangent and that gives me theta is arc tangent of x over2。😡，This is fine。

 This is okay。 indeed， And for the theta that we have up there。

 we might actually just want to go and plug this in directly in places the theta。

 the arc 10 of x over 2。But when I have something like sine of arc tangent or cosine of arc tangent。

 I feel like we can do better than just plugging into the arc tangangent。

 I want to go and try to evaluate that in sort of nice polynomials and square roots and things that I understand a little bit better。

 Sine of arc tangangent， I don't know what that is。So how can I do this？ Well。

 if I say x is equal to twice tangent theta， another way to write that is x over 2 is tangent of theta。

 Well， this sets up a triangle。 remember， this is indeed trigonometry。

 So I'm going to make a triangle is going to have an angle of theta and its tangent is going to be x divided by 2。

 So in other words， if I set its opposite to be x， it's adjacent to be 2。

 Tent of theta would be x over 2。 And then the hypotenus by Pythagoras is going to be the square root of the two squared plus the x squared。

So now I know everything I could care to know about this particular triangle。

 I could figure out sine of theta。 Sine of theta is just going to be the x over the square root of two squared plus x squared。

 In other words， opposite over hypotenase， I can do cosine of theta。

 that's going to be the a Jcent over the hypo。 As soon as I wrote down that triangle。

 I could figure out everything else。Now， if I go all the way back to my original equation。

 this's right in terms of theta， now I know what sine of theta is。

 Now I know what cosine of theta is， and the theta thats stuck out the front。

 I can just put in the a1。 So plugging all of these different things inside of it。 What do I get。

 I going to get the 116th。The arc tangent of the x over 2。

 and then the twice and I multiply the two different expressions for sine and cosine and I get 4 x divided out by 4 plus x squared。

And then the all important plus C， because it's an indefinite integral。

So what is an indefinite interval， There's this little bit of an extra step that you have to go through this bit more of a rig rule。

 You can't just choose what the values of theta are going to be and put that into your limits of integration and plug the numbers in。

You get this final answer in terms of theta and you use triangles to convert it back into answers in terms of x。

😡。
