In the first video on integration by partial fractions， we studied rational functions。

 polynomial divided by a polynomial， where the polynomial on the bottom could be written as a product of non repeating linear terms。

 And when we had this， then what we would try to do is a little bit of algebra where we would manipulate it so that it was a constant divided by each of the different linear terms in turn。

 And then we would go and do some algebra to try to figure what the A， the B。

 the C and so on we're going to be。 But in this video。

 we want to talk about what what happens if it repeats and what happens if there's a term that is nonline。

 For example， consider this quadratic term。 Imagine this was in the denominator。

 something like x squared plus one。 And the question is。

 can we factor that as a product of two linear terms。 Well， if we could。

 then the A and the B here would be0。 So I'm interested in studying what are the zeroes of a quadratic like this。

😊，However， there are no real zeros of this。 Indeed， if you move the one to the other side。

 then you're asking， I want to square a number and have that be negative， it's just not possible。

 Or alternatively， I take a square root of both sides。 You're asking what is the square root of-1。

 It is not a real number。 So as a result of this。 We're going to say that that x squared plus one quadratic。

 This is something we call irreducible。 And what that means is it has no roots。

 no zeros that are real numbers。 There's something called complex numbers。

 and it will have solutions over there。 but that's a topic beyond the domain of calculus 2。

 But nonetheless， I'm not able to factor。 It is the product of two linear terms with real numbers。

 And more generally than that， if I take a generic quadratic and A X squared plus a B x plus C。

 Then we know how to factor this by the quadratic formula。

 The formula is that x is minus B plus or minus a square root of B squared-4 A。😊。

Go over to a May it a mouthful。point is that this is only doable。

 I can only use the quadratic formula if the thing inside of the square root is positive。

 so I can only find two factors， and therefore will' only be able to factor it as a product of linear terms。

 if we have that B squared minus-4 a being positive。 So when that's not the case when it's negative。

 we call it irreducible。 there's nothing we can do to these quadratics that just sit there and I cannot break them up as a product of linear terms。

 Okay， so now I'm try to do partial fractions， I've got one of these quadratic factors on the base。

 what can I do。 So if I have an irreducible factor。

 So quadratic that I cannot reduce into linear terms。

 then the thing I guess in my partial fraction decomposition is you put the quadratic on the bottom。

 but now you put a generic linear on the top， not a generic constant。 So that is。

 I guess an A X plus B And I have to find both the A and the B。 So as an example in this one。😊。

I have one linear and one quadratic on the bottom。 And what I'm trying to do is do a partial fraction decomposition for the linear term。

 the x -1， I just put a constant。 It's a over x -1。 And that's what I'm going to guess。

 But for the quadratic term， the x squared plus1， I put a generic B X plus C。

 that is a generic linear term up in the new rid。So that's how I deal with quadratics。

 But what happens if things repeat。 But in that case。

 there's another little bit of a trick that I need to do。 So if I have a repeated factor。

 that is the same linear factor， but multiple times over。

 then what I have to do is guess all powers of。 What I mean by that is if I have something like a over x -1 squared。

 I want to guess a term that's got x -1 in the denominator and a term that's got x -1 squared in the denominator。

 And for both of those， I put a constant A and B up on the top。 This was higher。

 say x -1 to the power of 5 on the bottom， you needed an x -1 and x -1 squared all the way up to an x -1 to the power of 5 with an A B。

C， D and E constants。 and get a little bit complicated。

 But the basic idea is if you have a repetition， you use the highest power and all of the lower powers。

 those are the terms you need to add。😊，Okay， let's test it out in a concrete example。

 So in this next example， let's analyze what goes on the denominator。 I have a couple things。

 First of all， I have a linear term that is repeated。 When I look at the yellow X squared there。

 This is a reducible quadratic， not an irreducible one。

 x squared it can be written it as x -0 times x -0。 just x times x。 So this is a repeated。

 linear factor， not an irreducible quadratic。 But x squared plus 1， as we saw before。

 is an irreducible quadratic。😊，So what is the guess for my partial fraction decomposition。

 well it's going to have four different constants。For the repeated linear， the x squared。

 I put an x squared term and an x term。 So an A over x and a B over x squared。😡。

And then for the irreducible quadratic， I have to add a linear term up top。

 So I put the irreducible quadratic in the bottom。 and then a Cx plus D up on the top。

 So this is my decomposition。 But now I have to try to figure out what is the A BC and D。

 So that's just gonna take a little bit of algebra it' very similar to the first example。

 but we've got more constants and there's more tricky things and the integrals at the end get a little bit trickier。

 So let's see how that works out。 Well， the first thing we're gonna do is we're gonna multiply everything by the denominator。

 Really， what I think about is multiply by the entire denominator then canceling whatever appears。

 So， for example， for the a over x， I remove one factor of x。

 and therefore I get multipied by the other factor of x and the irreducible。

 Now I'm really getting squished down here。 but I'm going write it all out。

 So I've got my ABC and D and all of those are multiplied just by polynomials。

 I to remove myself entirely。 Now what I want to do is a bit of a rearrangement。

 Instead of having it ABC D。😊，Times various things。

 I want it to be powers of X times the various constants。 That is， if I rearrange this。

 I can say that in front of the x cubed terms， there was1 a and1 C in front of the x squared terms。

 there is a B and a D in front of the X term， there was an A in in front of the constant term。

 which Ill write down as a1 there is just gonna to be a B。 then on the left hand side。

 I've done nothing more than just color code， the polynomials。 And I will note that there is。

 in fact， a x cubed term here is just zero times x cubed。 there's a constant one term here。

 it's the three times the1。 So even though I only have x squared and x highlighted in blue。

 all four do appear on the left hand side just implicitly。 All right， hello again。

 this equation that I have here is actually four different equations。

 They very independently depending on the powers of X。 So there's a cubeic term， a quadratic term。

 a linear term and a constant term。 and I can pull them out。😊，So for example， the cubic term。

 well there's no cubics on the left hand side， so as zero。

 and then on the right hand side the cubs are a plus C for the quadratic term。

 there's a5 on the left hand side in front of the x squared and on the right hand side of b plus D so I set phi equal to b plus D and so on。

😡，So the big one equation in terms of the x' is has separated into four different equations。

 How do I solve this？ Well， a final two， it turns out are really easy。 So a is1 and B is equal to 3。

 Good， I don't have to do any more。 But now that I know that a is equal to1。

 let's look at what happens from the top line。 if a is1， and a plus C is0。

 then that's going to tell me that C is -1。And likewise， if b is 3 and5 is b plus D， so 3 plus D。

 then that means that D has to be2。So now I have my AB D。

 And what I want to do is I want to take these and put them back into that partial fraction decomposition。

 Well， I've got my number。 So let me go and move them in。

 And now I finally have something that's nice， something that I can go and try to integrate。

 Remember， we began with a messy rational function that we didn't know how to integrate。

 We have now done the algebra of the partial fraction decomposition and turn it into something that hopefully we'll see in a moment that hopefully is going to be a little bit easier for us to integrate。

 Well， how should we do this。 What I'm going to do is， first of all。

 wrap everything in terms of an integral sign。 And the first two integrals are pretty easy。

 They very first one， It's just going to be a logarithm 1 over x goes to logarithm。

 The second is just a power rule。 This is3 x to the -2。 So it goes to -3 x to the -1。 Now。

 the third integral， however， is a little bit more complicated。

 You notice right off the bat that they sort of obvious U substitution of the denominator。😊。

It doesn't work out。 The D is not the numerator。 So one thing I can do is try splitting it up is two different integrals。

 So I'm going to do that。 I get a minus X on the top over this thing on the bottom and I get a two over this thing on the bottom is two separate integrals。

 Maybe that's gonna to make my life easier。😡，Well， in this particular scenario。

 now a U substitution does work。 In other words， if I set my U to be my denominator。

 So an x square plus1 is du U is a 2 X， D X， I have an X on the top。 So outside of the factor of 2。

 which I can divide that， I get a -1 half。 This just looks like 1 over U D U。

And I know how to integrate one over U， that's just going to be a logarithm。

 so I can replace this with negative1 and half the logarithm of U and u was x squared plus1。

 so the logarithm of x squared plus1。😡，And then finally。

 I have to go and deal with this final fourth integral。

 And this one is either jumps out at you or it doesn't。

 This is the anti derivative of arc tangent or more precisely twice a tangent。 So I put that down。

 I add my plus C， and I am done。😊。
