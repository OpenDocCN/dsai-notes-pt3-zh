So far in CalculusÔºå we've been focusing on what I call explicit functions„ÄÇ

 functions where you have a y and it's just given as some function of x„ÄÇ

 and then the standard problem that we might ask isÔºå can we take the derivative of this function„ÄÇ

 we'd ask for what is F prime of x„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_2.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_3.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_4.png)

But a lot of functions aren't naturally given explicitlyÔºå they're given instead implicitly„ÄÇ

 so here's an example„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_6.png)

I have some equation x squared plus y squared is equal to1„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_8.png)

NowÔºå for every value of xÔºå there may or may not be some number of y's that you can find such that for that x and y pairing„ÄÇ

 this equation is true„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_10.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_11.png)

So we want to try to see if given an implicit functionÔºå some just equation involving x and y„ÄÇ

 perhaps more variables if they were aroundÔºå can we tease out explicit functions from themÔºü



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_13.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_14.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_15.png)

For exampleÔºå this equation is known to be the equation of a circle„ÄÇ

 so I can graph it and it's going to look like this indeed this is a circle of radius1 and all of the different points that are going to be on this have that x squared plus y squared is equal to1„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_17.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_18.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_19.png)

NowÔºå let me try to solve and make this Y is some function of X„ÄÇ Let's see if we're able to do that„ÄÇ

 I'm going to put all the y to one sides first„ÄÇ So I'm going to say that y squared is equal to 1 minus x squared„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_21.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_22.png)

And then I want to not have y squaredÔºå and I want it explicitly is y as a function of x„ÄÇ

 so why don't I take a square rootÔºü

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_24.png)

But as soon they have square rootsÔºå we remember there's an issue because there's positive and minus square roots„ÄÇ

 so I kind of want to write it like this y is plus or minus the square root of1 minus x squared„ÄÇ

 either would be satisfying this original equation„ÄÇ

 but this violates the vertical line test to be a function„ÄÇ

 it needs to be the case that for every x valueÔºå there's exactly1 y value„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_26.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_27.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_28.png)

Or if I want to think about it graphicallyÔºå what you do is you draw a vertical line and you say„ÄÇ

 wellÔºå look for this particular x valueÔºå there's two different y values this top in this bottom that correspond to it„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_30.png)

So it's not the case that we can find one function y equals f of x that describes this entire circle„ÄÇ

 but you'll notice that I have a yellow semicircle on the top and a red semicircle on the bottom„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_32.png)

I could break these out as two different functionsÔºå one that describes the top„ÄÇ

 one that describes the bottom using the plus and the minus that I have in my square root„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_34.png)

In other wordsÔºå what I have is two different functionsÔºå one„ÄÇ

 the y equals the positive square root that describe the topÔºå one„ÄÇ

 the negative square root that describes the bottom„ÄÇ

 and so that this one equation has resulted in these two different explicit formulas„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_36.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_37.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_38.png)

So maybe now my question should beÔºå I want to find the derivative of y with respect to X„ÄÇ

And the idea is going to be that if I want to take the derivative over here„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the yellowÔºå and if I want to take the derivative down here„ÄÇ

 I'm going to use the red„ÄÇüò°ÔºåNow we might ask the question„ÄÇ

 what's the derivative of y with respect to X One answer would be I could just look at where I'm interested„ÄÇ

 if I'm interested hereÔºå I'm going to use the positive square rootÔºå the yellow„ÄÇ

 if I'm interested in the derivative down hereÔºå I'll use the negative square root the red„ÄÇ

 but I want to have a bit more of a systematic way to compute the derivative So the way I'm going to deal with this is I'm going to take my x squared plus y squared equal to1„ÄÇ

 but instead of a y I'm going to write y of x or I'm thinking that y implicitly depends on x„ÄÇ

 even though though I don't necessarily know what the actual function is„ÄÇ

 it's just some function of x„ÄÇüò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_40.png)

Then this is an equation and I could take the derivative with respect to x of both sides of that equation„ÄÇ

 I can add one to both sides of an equationÔºå I could take the derivative of both sides of an equation„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_42.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_43.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_44.png)

So let's see what happens if I do thatÔºå so I'm taking the derivative of the x squared„ÄÇ

 the derivative of the y squared and the derivative of the one„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_46.png)

Now the derivative of the x squaredÔºå that's entirely reasonable is's just 2 x„ÄÇ

 the derivative of the1Ôºå we know what that isÔºå that's just zero„ÄÇ

 but what about the derivative of the y squaredÔºü

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_48.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_49.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_50.png)

What I want to think about when I take the derivative of the y squared is there's an inside function„ÄÇ

 the yÔºå and there's the outside functionÔºå the squaring function so y squared is a composition there's an outside and there's an inside so when I take its derivative you take the chain rule drew the outside so2 y then times the derivative to the inside times y prime So putting all that together what I'm going to get is this formula x squared down to the2 x Y squared down to the by chain rule2 y dy dx and the derivative of1 is just going to be0 now that I'm at this stop„ÄÇ

 I can just do a little bit of rearranging and identify the dy dx it's minus2 x over2 y or minus x divided by y„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_52.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_53.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_54.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_55.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_56.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_57.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_58.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_59.png)

Now I want to note that just notationallyÔºå I've written Y of X and all of these different spots„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_61.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_62.png)

But it's quite conventional for us to not actually write the of x everywhere and instead just to treat this as ys in every one of these spots„ÄÇ

 but we're keeping it in our mind that indeed these are going to be functions of x and so that I need to indeed apply the chain rule at these spots so now let's return to the original problem but now I'm asking the slope at a particular point minus one over root  two plus one over root two and you could take the squares of these things and it would add up to one so it is indeed a point on a circle indeed it's a point on a circle right about there„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_64.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_65.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_66.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_67.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_68.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_69.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_70.png)

So how do I figure this outÔºå I know that the slope with a tangent line is given by the derivative is given by DYdX„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_72.png)

And our formula for this was minus x divided out by y„ÄÇAnd then if I want to evaluate this„ÄÇ

 these big long vertical lines mean evaluationÔºå if I want to evaluate this at the pair xy equal to minus one over root 2„ÄÇ

1 over root 2Ôºå well we could do that computation and then when I evaluate at this particular point what I'm going to get to well minus minus is a positive so I'm going to have just the one over root2 on the top„ÄÇ

üò°„ÄÇ

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_74.png)

![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_75.png)

And then plugging in for the YÔºå which I have right here is the one divided by root two„ÄÇ

 and this whole thing is just going to be equal to value of one„ÄÇ



![](img/cbe46532801f8f8e83b2fa755bf49543_77.png)

And then if I want to plot itÔºå so I'm looking around here and this is going to be my tangent line„ÄÇ

 it looks like I've got a nice slope of one and it occurs at this pointÔºå minus one over root2„ÄÇ

 one over root two„ÄÇNote by the wayÔºå if I ask a slightly different question„ÄÇ

 what happens at this point right hereÔºå this is the point x equal to minus1 and y equal to zero„ÄÇWell„ÄÇ

 if x is equal to minus1Ôºå then I'm going to get a1 hereÔºå y divided by zero„ÄÇ

 that gives me a vertical asymptote„ÄÇSo at this particular point right here„ÄÇ

 we're going to have this straight up vertical line that is that is what the slope of the tangent line is„ÄÇ

LikewiseÔºå we can answer the same question over here again our y is going to be zeroÔºå again„ÄÇ

 we're going to have a division by zero„ÄÇ
