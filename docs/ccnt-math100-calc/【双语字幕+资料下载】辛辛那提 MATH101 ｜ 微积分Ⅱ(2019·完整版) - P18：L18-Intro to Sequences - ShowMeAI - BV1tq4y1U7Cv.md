Consider this list of numbers，1，1， half，1 third，1/ quarter，1， fifth， and so on。

 This is the idea of a sequence。 A sequence is just a list。 There's a first element。

 a second element， a third element。 And you have this ordered list that goes on for forever。

 Another example might be this one，1 half，2 thirds，3 quarters，4 fifths and so on。

 you can sort of see what the pattern is。 Indeed， there's a third example， which is like -1，1，-1，1。

-1，1 that goes back and forth that way。 The point is as long as I have a first element。

 a second element， a third element， and so on。 I have a sequence。

 It doesn't even need to follow a nice pattern like these ones。 For example， the digits of pi，3，1，4。

1，5 and so on。 that forms a sequence that is never going to be repeating that has no nice predictable pattern to it。

😊，And then my general notation is to use a sub I notation so I could have a listing of different elements。

 the first element we call a1， the second element A2， the third element A3 and so on。

 and then the completely general way to talk about this is to do braces with a sub n in the center where n is thought of is just some natural number and that's my shorthand for the entire sequence。

Now， what we've done here is pretty good where I've just listed the elements and maybe you can see a pattern。

 maybe you can， depending on how complicated it is。

 but often we want to be a bit more explicit about that。

 So the other way that I can represent sequences is socalled explicitly defined where I say the a sub n。

 And I just tell you what the expression is for that。 So in this example。

 I'm saying a sub n is just one over n。 So for example。

 if n is equal to1 a1 is one over one and if I put in two， then a2 is one over2。

 So a half and in general is gonna to be one third， one fourth，1， fifth，1，6， and so on。

 So if I have an explicit formula like this， I can come up and list out the elements。

 what the other way around。 suppose I give you the second example that I have for this one half two thirds。

 threequarters，4 fifths。 Does that sequence have an explicit formula。

 why don't you pause and see whether you can find it。😊，When I look at it。

 I look specifically at the numerators， I see the first term got a1 in the numerator。

 the second to two in the numerator， the third of three in the numerator。 But in the denominator。

 it's all one higher than that。 the first term has a two in the denominator。 The second term has a3。

 So the generic formula for this is going to be an n on the top， But an n plus1 on the bottom。

 So indeed， in general， we will say that a sub n is n over n plus1。 You give me any natural n。

 and we can figure out what the term in the sequence is going to be。 Okay。

 now let's go and look at the third example。 This is the example where we had the minus1 and the1 alternating back and fourth。

 So my goal is to find an explicit formula for this。

 So I plug in say n equal to4 into some formula for the a sub n， I'll get out in this case， just1。

 what can I do。 I want something that alternates between the -1 and the1 back and forth like this。

 So what about this one，-1 to the power of n。All odd powers of n， like for example。

 n equal to1 minus1 to the power of1 is just gonna to be11 to the power of three is11 to the power of5 is1。

 but for even powers it becomes plus one minus1 squared to the fours or the six all of those are plus one So indeed。

 this explicit formula matches these original sequence that I'm talking about Now this video just establish some of the basic terminology and ideas of sequence that's really going to be the base for the next big portion of calculus that we're going to do。

 but in the next video we're going to talk about the limit of a sequence and think about one more way to conceptualize what a sequence is。
