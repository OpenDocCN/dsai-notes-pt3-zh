# P38ï¼šL38- Relative and Absolute Maximums and Minimums _ Part II - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Now of course this graph could represent all sorts of different things we've talked about energy and population size and profit and all sorts of different things so now the question is how do I actually find these points I'm given a graph I can sort of approximately guess what these are going to be but how do I actually find out exactly where these extrema occur and what values they get out and that's where calculus is going to be so useful to us Let's go back to that prala that we saw beforeï¼Ÿ

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_2.png)

I want to notice something about the maximum that we have hereã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_4.png)

If I look at this maximumï¼Œ when I put its tangent line on hereï¼Œ wellã€‚

 its tangent line looks like it's completely horizontal at that particular maximum pointã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_6.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_7.png)

That isï¼Œ this horizontal tangent line means that the derivativeã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_9.png)

At this particular point1 is going to be equal to zeroã€‚

 so I'm just going to note this that the derivative of this one is0 and that f of 1 is going to be a relative maximumã€‚

 so this might lead us to thinkï¼Œ lead us to conclude perhaps that whenever the derivative was zero that that was going to be a maximum or a minimumã€‚

 possiblyï¼Œ but let's investigate to see whether that's actually true because I have two different questionsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_11.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_12.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_13.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_14.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_15.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_16.png)

The first question that I have for you isï¼Œ is it the case that every single time the derivative of a zero that you're going to get either a relative maximum or minimumã€‚

 we saw that one example of a problem it sort looked like it was the case thereã€‚

 but can we think of any other example where that's not the caseï¼Ÿ



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_18.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_19.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_20.png)

And then the second question isï¼Œ well this idea of a derivative being zero horizontal tangent line or correspondinging to a maximum or minimumã€‚

 that's lovelyï¼Œ but is it ever possible for other values or for the derivative notex that you could have a maximum or a minimum in other wordsã€‚

 is this condition of the derivative equal to zero necessary or other possibilitiesï¼Ÿ



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_22.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_23.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_24.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_25.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_26.png)

Ponder about whether either of these questions is trueã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_28.png)

And you're going to pause the videoï¼Œ rightï¼Œ do I have to play the the pausing montageï¼Œ all rightï¼Ÿ



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_30.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_31.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_32.png)

All rightï¼Œ so I think I've come up with examples that illustrate what's going on for both of these questionsã€‚

 so let's look just at the first one firstã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_34.png)

Consider the graph of something like a cubitï¼Œ notice how it goes up and then it flattens out and then it carries on going upã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_36.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_37.png)

And indeedï¼Œ if I look at this point of x equal to 1 and I try to draw the tangent lineã€‚

 it is horizontal thereï¼Œ in other wordsï¼Œ the derivative is equal to zeroã€‚

 and yet that's not a maximum or a minimumã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_39.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_40.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_41.png)

It's the sort of like halfway point where it flattens out but then carries on going up So the answer to the question is noã€‚

 indeed it is the case that sometimes the derivative can be zeroã€‚

 but it is not a maximum or a minimumã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_43.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_44.png)

Okayï¼Œ so let's look at the second of the two questions this was askingã€‚

 could it be the case that FFCc was a maximum minimumï¼Œ even though the derivative was non zeroï¼Ÿ



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_46.png)

Nowï¼Œ it turns out that if it's any other value like seven or three that indeed it wouldn't be a maximum or minimumã€‚

 howeverï¼Œ what if the derivative didn't existï¼ŸLet me look at this exampleã€‚

 so this is an example that has some sort of absolute value in itã€‚

And what we have here is this corner right at the topã€‚

One of the things that we know is that the derivative at any cussp point does not existã€‚

 yet clearly from our picture that looks like a maximumï¼Œ so I will say that the F prime of oneã€‚

 the derivative at the value of  one does not existï¼Œ even though F of1 itself is still a maximumã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_48.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_49.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_50.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_51.png)

And so the answer to this problem is yesï¼Œ it is possible to be a maximumã€‚

 even if the derivative is non zeroï¼Œ it could be a situation like this where the derivative does not existã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_53.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_54.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_55.png)

So now what I want to do to try to clean things up a little bit is I want to take these two categoriesã€‚

 the derivative is zero and the derivative does not existã€‚

 and I'm going to bundle them together by introducing a new definitionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

I am going to refer to a critical numberï¼Œ that's something in the domain that's an input valueã€‚

 a critical number C has the property that either derivative is zero or the derivative does not existã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_57.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_58.png)

And the reason why I'm choosing critical numbers is something to be interested in is because there' are two motivating examplesã€‚

 one where the derivative is zero and you get the horizontal tangent line and the other where you have this maximum occurring where the derivative does not existã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_60.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_61.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_62.png)

So these are useful spots for us to investigateã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_64.png)

And in factï¼Œ there is a very important theorem here it's referred to as for Mois theorem and it says that every single one of those relative maximums and minimums it must occur at a critical number In other wordsã€‚

 if you don't have a critical number you don't have a maximum or a minimum So what we know is that we're supposed to look for these critical numbersã€‚

 all of these critical numbers are candidates to be maximums or minimums howeverã€‚

 we know that just because it has a derivative equal to zeroï¼Œ come up with exampleã€‚

 just because its's derivative does not exist doesn't mean it's a maximum or a minimum In other wordsã€‚

 not all critical numbers are going to give a maximum or minimum only some of the critical numbers are going to give maximums or minimumsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_66.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_67.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_68.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_69.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_70.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_71.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_72.png)

Or another way to rephrase it is to say that the critical numbers are the candidates to be relative maximums or minimumsã€‚

So the process goes a little bit like thisï¼Œ you go and find all the critical numbersã€‚

 you take its derivativeï¼Œ you figure out where the derivative is zero or the derivative does not existã€‚

And that gives you the set of candidatesï¼Œ but only some of them are maximums and minimums and we're stillã€‚

 if I just tell you that it's a critical numberï¼Œ you don't know which it isï¼Œ is it a maxã€‚

 is it a min or is it neitherï¼Œ so then you have to do some further analysis to determine whether it truly is a max a min or neitherã€‚

So to summarize this particular methodï¼Œ if our goal is to figure out the maximums and the minimums on an intervalã€‚

 the first thing I want to do is find all of the critical numbersã€‚

 at least all of them that are in the actual specify domainã€‚

 I just don't care about critical numbers outside of thatã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_74.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_75.png)

![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_76.png)

Secondlyï¼Œ I want to go and I want to compute what f of x isã€‚

 what the value is for every one of the critical numbersã€‚



![](img/82f9cf42fb6733d3535cdd3352b5ebae_78.png)

And the endpoints of your domainã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ it's often the case that the endpoints aren't themselves critical numbers that will sort of go upã€‚

 and then you just hit the barrierï¼Œ and it could still be a maximumã€‚

 So youve got to figure out what F of x is for the critical numbers and each endpointã€‚

And then finallyï¼Œ you've got this list of values and you can just look at them and figure out well which of them is really the biggestã€‚

 that's the absolute maxï¼Œ which of them is the smallest as the absolute menã€‚

 and then you have to be a little bit more careful with determining which of these intermediate ones are going to be the relative maxes and the relative minimumsã€‚

And then as a checkï¼Œ it's always perfectly fine to try to go and graph the thing and to see whether or not the maximums and minimums that you've computed exactly appear to roughly be the case from the graphã€‚
