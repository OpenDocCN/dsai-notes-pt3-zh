In our second video on how to take things we've done before in cculus and apply them in the context of a parametric curve。

 We're going to look at areas enclosed by some particular curve。 That is， in this case。

 I have this parametric curve that saw in the previous video。

 And now I am interested in what is the area inside of that little loop。😊，Well。

 recall that we've done areas before。 And what we usually did back in the day was write it as y is a function of x。

 and that we describe this height as going from the x axis up to whatever our function was。

 So if I just， for example， take the positive half of this and maybe multiply by two by symmetrymetry at the end。

 But just take the positive haps， then that's just a familiar y is F of X。

 And then what we would typically say would be that the area was going to be the integral from a to B。

 some left endpoint and some right end point on your x values。 of the y， or in other words。

 the F of x D X。 But what we're now going to be talking about is parametric curves where x is a function of T and where y is a function of T。

 And in that case， what I'm going to consider is x A F of T and y say G of T。

 And I don't have limits on the x values。 I have a limit alpha and beta on the T values that T is constrained between an alpha and a beta。

 And you can line them up with the previous formula by saying that the a is。😊，The F。 remember。

 F is the function that represents the X at the value of alpha。

 and B is equal to the F at the value of beta。 But nonetheless。

 I have to switch from A's to B's to alpha is to beta is to keep the difference between X and T separate。

And then if I want to plug this in， I'm going to claim I get the following formula。

 I claim it's integral from alpha to beta。 It's an integral with respect to T。 It's got a Dt there。

 And then this big F of little F times F prime。 why do I write this down。 Well。

 this is a substitution rule。 recall how typically substitution， we do a U substitution。

 But because I'm going between x and T， I'm going to do an X substitution here。 That is。

 if I look at what F of T is。 F of T。 the lowercase F of T is nothing but X。

 And then if I look at what F prime of T D T is。 Well， that's going to be the same thing as D X。

 So if you apply the substitution rule to the second formula。

 you get precisely the first formula just， or I'm not doing a U substitution。

 I'm doing as sort of X substitution。 just a change of my labeling。 But nonetheless， the same idea。

All right， Well， now let me look at this capital F of lower case of F of T。 Remember。

 capital F is representing the y is representing the height。 And because it's a composition。

 the innermost thing is a function of T。 But this is nothing but the function。 G of T。

 G of T also represents Y represents the height above the X axis。 And is also a function of T。

 These are the same thing。 So capital F of lower case of F of T is nothing but G of T。 All right。

 so that's my formula for the area beneath some parametermetric curve down to the x axis。

 And in between the npoint of t equal to alpha and t equal to beta。 All right。

 so let's do that for the specific example we've seen before。 In this example。

 the x or the f of T was t squared and the y or the G of T was T cubed -3 T。

 I'm going to have to compute F prime。 So I can go and do that。 F prime is2 T。

 And then I want to figure out the M points for my integration。Now， I'm going to do one little trick。

 which is to exploit some symmetry。 I'm only going to consider the top half of this that allows me to do this stuff above the x axis。

 and then I can multiply by 2。 Indeed， for any fixed x value。

 the y is got a positive and the negative。 It's completely symmetric over the X axis。

 So I'm allowed to do this， just consider the top half and multiply by two trick。 Well。

 what are the endpoint for just the top half of this。 Well， if I plug in x equal to 0。

 This is sort of the left end point in x。 P in an x equal to 0 gives me that t is equal to 0。

 So when t is 0， I'm at that leftmost point。😊，And then when x is equal to 3。

 I get that t is either equal to plus or minus the square root of 3。 Now。

 it's correct that there's two different t values here， because， for example。

 if you started at at 30， say t equal to minus root3。

 And then you can carry on increasing your values of t until you get to t equal to root 3。

 You've gone around the loop and up exactly back at 30。 But because I'm only doing the tau half。

 I only need to do it once。 I'm going from the left to the right。

 I'm just going use t equal to the positive square root of3， multiply by2 of my answer。

 So what do I have， I have that two of the front， because I'm just doing the top half。

 Then the integral from 0 up to positive square root of 3。

 And then I put in my G of t and I multip my G of t by my f prime of T。 And well。

 this is just some particular integral。 I can go off and compute it。

 And what do I get just whatever this thing is doesn't really matter。 It's a definite integral。

 So now we have replaced our ability to do areas under curves。 not for y equal to f of x。

 but for parametric。By the way， I'll note that I'm doing a simple example here。

 But if you recall back with calculus 1， we had issues， for example。

 where a function was above and below the axis。 and you had to break it up into two regions and the portions beneath the axis werere going to count negatively and the portions above would count positively。

 same story would be true here。 Likewise， if you had a region that was in between multiple regions you would take the top one and you subtract off the bottom one。

 So， yes， there's some richness that can occur here。 But it's all based on the same formula。

 this integral of the G of T times F prime of T Dt。
