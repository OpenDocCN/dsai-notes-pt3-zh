# P40ï¼šL40-Area under a Parametric Curve _ Formula, Derivation, & Example - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In our second video on how to take things we've done before in cculus and apply them in the context of a parametric curveã€‚

 We're going to look at areas enclosed by some particular curveã€‚ That isï¼Œ in this caseã€‚

 I have this parametric curve that saw in the previous videoã€‚

 And now I am interested in what is the area inside of that little loopã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWellã€‚

 recall that we've done areas beforeã€‚ And what we usually did back in the day was write it as y is a function of xã€‚

 and that we describe this height as going from the x axis up to whatever our function wasã€‚

 So if I justï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ take the positive half of this and maybe multiply by two by symmetrymetry at the endã€‚

 But just take the positive hapsï¼Œ then that's just a familiar y is F of Xã€‚

 And then what we would typically say would be that the area was going to be the integral from a to Bã€‚

 some left endpoint and some right end point on your x valuesã€‚ of the yï¼Œ or in other wordsã€‚

 the F of x D Xã€‚ But what we're now going to be talking about is parametric curves where x is a function of T and where y is a function of Tã€‚

 And in that caseï¼Œ what I'm going to consider is x A F of T and y say G of Tã€‚

 And I don't have limits on the x valuesã€‚ I have a limit alpha and beta on the T values that T is constrained between an alpha and a betaã€‚

 And you can line them up with the previous formula by saying that the a isã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒThe Fã€‚ rememberã€‚

 F is the function that represents the X at the value of alphaã€‚

 and B is equal to the F at the value of betaã€‚ But nonethelessã€‚

 I have to switch from A's to B's to alpha is to beta is to keep the difference between X and T separateã€‚

And then if I want to plug this inï¼Œ I'm going to claim I get the following formulaã€‚

 I claim it's integral from alpha to betaã€‚ It's an integral with respect to Tã€‚ It's got a Dt thereã€‚

 And then this big F of little F times F primeã€‚ why do I write this downã€‚ Wellã€‚

 this is a substitution ruleã€‚ recall how typically substitutionï¼Œ we do a U substitutionã€‚

 But because I'm going between x and Tï¼Œ I'm going to do an X substitution hereã€‚ That isã€‚

 if I look at what F of T isã€‚ F of Tã€‚ the lowercase F of T is nothing but Xã€‚

 And then if I look at what F prime of T D T isã€‚ Wellï¼Œ that's going to be the same thing as D Xã€‚

 So if you apply the substitution rule to the second formulaã€‚

 you get precisely the first formula justï¼Œ or I'm not doing a U substitutionã€‚

 I'm doing as sort of X substitutionã€‚ just a change of my labelingã€‚ But nonethelessï¼Œ the same ideaã€‚

All rightï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ now let me look at this capital F of lower case of F of Tã€‚ Rememberã€‚

 capital F is representing the y is representing the heightã€‚ And because it's a compositionã€‚

 the innermost thing is a function of Tã€‚ But this is nothing but the functionã€‚ G of Tã€‚

 G of T also represents Y represents the height above the X axisã€‚ And is also a function of Tã€‚

 These are the same thingã€‚ So capital F of lower case of F of T is nothing but G of Tã€‚ All rightã€‚

 so that's my formula for the area beneath some parametermetric curve down to the x axisã€‚

 And in between the npoint of t equal to alpha and t equal to betaã€‚ All rightã€‚

 so let's do that for the specific example we've seen beforeã€‚ In this exampleã€‚

 the x or the f of T was t squared and the y or the G of T was T cubed -3 Tã€‚

 I'm going to have to compute F primeã€‚ So I can go and do thatã€‚ F prime is2 Tã€‚

 And then I want to figure out the M points for my integrationã€‚Nowï¼Œ I'm going to do one little trickã€‚

 which is to exploit some symmetryã€‚ I'm only going to consider the top half of this that allows me to do this stuff above the x axisã€‚

 and then I can multiply by 2ã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ for any fixed x valueã€‚

 the y is got a positive and the negativeã€‚ It's completely symmetric over the X axisã€‚

 So I'm allowed to do thisï¼Œ just consider the top half and multiply by two trickã€‚ Wellã€‚

 what are the endpoint for just the top half of thisã€‚ Wellï¼Œ if I plug in x equal to 0ã€‚

 This is sort of the left end point in xã€‚ P in an x equal to 0 gives me that t is equal to 0ã€‚

 So when t is 0ï¼Œ I'm at that leftmost pointã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd then when x is equal to 3ã€‚

 I get that t is either equal to plus or minus the square root of 3ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 it's correct that there's two different t values hereï¼Œ becauseï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 if you started at at 30ï¼Œ say t equal to minus root3ã€‚

 And then you can carry on increasing your values of t until you get to t equal to root 3ã€‚

 You've gone around the loop and up exactly back at 30ã€‚ But because I'm only doing the tau halfã€‚

 I only need to do it onceã€‚ I'm going from the left to the rightã€‚

 I'm just going use t equal to the positive square root of3ï¼Œ multiply by2 of my answerã€‚

 So what do I haveï¼Œ I have that two of the frontï¼Œ because I'm just doing the top halfã€‚

 Then the integral from 0 up to positive square root of 3ã€‚

 And then I put in my G of t and I multip my G of t by my f prime of Tã€‚ And wellã€‚

 this is just some particular integralã€‚ I can go off and compute itã€‚

 And what do I get just whatever this thing is doesn't really matterã€‚ It's a definite integralã€‚

 So now we have replaced our ability to do areas under curvesã€‚ not for y equal to f of xã€‚

 but for parametricã€‚By the wayï¼Œ I'll note that I'm doing a simple example hereã€‚

 But if you recall back with calculus 1ï¼Œ we had issuesï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 where a function was above and below the axisã€‚ and you had to break it up into two regions and the portions beneath the axis werere going to count negatively and the portions above would count positivelyã€‚

 same story would be true hereã€‚ Likewiseï¼Œ if you had a region that was in between multiple regions you would take the top one and you subtract off the bottom oneã€‚

 Soï¼Œ yesï¼Œ there's some richness that can occur hereã€‚ But it's all based on the same formulaã€‚

 this integral of the G of T times F prime of T Dtã€‚
