What of both the trigometric terms， here we've go a graph of cosine and a graph of sine。

 and I want to figure out what's the derivative of sine and what's the derivative of cosine。Now。

 in this video， I'm not going to go through the formal geometric proof of these derivatives。

 but I want to illustrate why my answers are going to be reasonable。

So let's go and look at sine of x and try to take the deroto assign s first and let me focus at the value of zero。

 so here is a tangent line to sine of x at the value of x equal to 0。😡，And this tangent line。

 it looks like it's got this nice slope here of approximately one isch。

But then cosine has the value of1 at zero。So in other words。

 it kind of looks like the tangent line of sine at zero and the function value of cosine are going to be the same thing。

All right， let's step along， What about it at this point Okay so now we've sort of flattened down a little bit。

 so if we were going to say that the original slope was one。

 this is a little bit less than one here for Psi。But I know what cosine of pi over4 is cosine of pi over4。

 I could draw the standard triangle， it's one divided by root2， a number a little bit less than one。

 so the slope is down down a little bit and the cosine has also gone down a little bit。

Likewise to the top here okay this one I can do easily。

 this is exactly horizontal so in other words the derivative of sine is zero at this value of pi over2。

 but cosine of pi over2 is equal to zero final one here， the slope started at zero。

 but now as we go beyond pi over2 is becoming negative the slope is negative。

 but likewise cosine it goes down as zero and then becomes as negative as well。

So what I'm sort of getting the sense of is the derivative of sine and the values of cosine seem to match a lot。

 so I'm going to claim here that indeed the derivative of sine is equal to cosine。😡，And by the way。

 you could do the same kind of analysis to go for what happens with cosine and you get the derivative of cosine is equal to negative the value of sine。

 For example， if I look at the derivative of cosine at0， it's horizontal。

 this is the same thing as the value of minus sine of0， its minus0。

 which is0 Now that I have these two established the sine and the cosine I can do a whole bunch of the other derivatives of triometric function。

 So how we do this one， I'm going to take the derivative。Of tangent of X。

Now tangent is sine divided by cosine， so in other words。

 what I'm saying is I want to do the derivative of sine of x divided out by cosine of x。

And then this is a quotient of two functions。 a sine divided out by the cosine。

 So I can use the quotient rule。 So let's see if we can remember how that works。 Okay。

 so first of all， it's the derivative of the top。 So derivative sine is cosine。😊。

Multiped by the bottom so it was F prime G， so'm multiplied by cosine。

 so I'm actually going to come up here and put a co squared in because it's cosine times cosine。

Then I subtract and what do I do if I put in the first thing so that was going to be sine of x except the F no derivative there and now I'm taking the derivative of the bottom。

 but the derivative of the bottom is derivative of cosine derivative of cosine is minus sign。

 So there was a minus here， but I'm going to turn it into a plus because I'm taking one more and then it's minus sign I've got another one here。

 so I'm going to put it a sine squared of x。 So that's top。😡。

And then all of this is going to be divided by the denominator， the cosine squared。

 so all of this divided by cosine squared x。So in other words。

 we've got in a decent way purely on our knowledge that tangent is defined to be sine over cosine。

 and then we apply the quotient rule。Now， there's one identity that's very important。

Co squared plus sine squared is equal to the value of one。So the co squared plus sine squared。

 I can just replace this with one， and then it's1 divided by co squared of x。

And one overco is the definition of Seaantant。So1 over co squared is the definition of Cantt squared。

 so this is going to be equal to Cantant squared of x。And then I could go through if I wanted。

 I'd done the derivative of 10 and go Ccan squared I could derivative of cotangent。

 derivative of Ccan， the derivative of co seccan， all of these different things are fractions of the ss and the cosines And so I could apply the quotient rule much the same way。

 use the same Pythagorean identity that co squared plus sine squared as one。

 and I could get a bunch of results。 The full list looks something like this。

It's sort of long and complicated if this is the first time you've seen it。

 way you know that in calculus， we're going to be using these derivatives so often that you're basically going to end up memorizing this particular chart just because you're going to use them over and over and over again。

 but in truth， you only need to know the sine and cosine once and then all of the other ones。

 if you remember the definition， for example， that cotangent is cosine over sign。

 you just apply the quotient rule and you can get this formula on the test。

 but it's a good idea is to go ahead and memorizing them just by practice and repetition of how many times we will use them。

😡。
