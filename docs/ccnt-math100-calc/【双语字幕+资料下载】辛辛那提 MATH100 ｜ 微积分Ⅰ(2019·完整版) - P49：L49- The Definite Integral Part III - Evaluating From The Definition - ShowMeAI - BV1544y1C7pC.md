Let's look once again at this idea of the area underneath function x squared between the values of0 and 1。

 in other words， I want to figure out what is going to be my area underneath this function。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_2.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_3.png)

Now what we've seen before is a couple things， first of all。

 we saw that we could approximate this by the sum of the areas of a bunch of different rectangles。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_5.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_6.png)

And then we've seen sort of philosophically that the idea is that we're going to allow the number of rectangles to go to infinity is going to go have a better and better approximation。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_8.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_9.png)

But now what I want to do in this video is use that idea approximating by rectangles and taking the limit and goes to infinity to actually get a value for this。

 no longer an approximation， but an actual number for it。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_11.png)

So I'm going to remind you that what we're doing in a different way of presenting it is a definite integral。

 the integral from0 to1， that's where I'm going between of the function x squared dx。

 and it's going to be written down as this computation we've done before。

 the limit then goes to infinity of the sum of some Xi squared delta x。😡。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_13.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_14.png)

And what I need to do to actually compute this thing。

 to actually make this thing be a number like seven or two or whatever the number is going to be。

 we'll have to figure it out。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_16.png)

Is I need to determine what is the deelta X， I need to figure out what exactly are the X's。

 and then I hopefully will result in some sum that we're actually able to compute。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_18.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_19.png)

So let's do the deelta x's first。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_21.png)

If I think about my interval is' from zero to one。And what I'm doing in my sum is I'm breaking this up into M different components。

 so my interval is now going to be broken up into n sub intervalters。😡。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_23.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_24.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_25.png)

So what's the width of one of these sub intervaltervals。 I've got an original width of one。

 I've divided it into n different pieces。 So I think the width is one over M。 In other words。

 we can see that the deelta x is whatever the original interval was from 0 to1 or a width of one minus0 divided into n pieces that I just left with one over M。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_27.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_28.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_29.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_30.png)

All right。What about the X I that I have here。 That's my next question。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_32.png)

So if I have this XI， what I want to figure out is some actual choice for it， if it's up to me。

 I could choose a left endpoint， a right endpoint， a midpoint， many different ones。

 I'm going to choose the right end point and I'm going to try to write down a formula in terms of I for this particular right endpoint。

😡。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_34.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_35.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_36.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_37.png)

And the way I want to think about this is I started zero， and then I go over one width one n。

 and then I go over two width， so two n then I go over three width， so 3 n and in general。

 what I'm going to say is that my Xi is I go over I amounts times whatever that delta X was。😡。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_39.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_40.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_41.png)

Okay， let's test to see if this formula makes sense if I chose I equal to1， so I'm looking at X I。

 it would just be with a delta x and that does make sense if I start at zero。

 then I'm saying I go over just one width and I'm going to the right endpoint。

 that's an amount deelta X over。😡。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_43.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_44.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_45.png)

And then if I choose a two here， so it's twice delta x， I'm saying I start at zero。

 I go over one delta x， I go over a second delta x。

 and that's the right end point of my second rectangle so I think this formula works。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_47.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_48.png)

Okay， so I've got this Delta X。 I've got this X I。 Let's take both of them。

 and we're going to put them into my formula here。 So what I get for this area， the limit of the sum。

😡，It's the X squared。 So I put in my X squares。And then it's the delta X that's the1 over n。

 so I multiply it there and it's this big messy gnarly expression。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_50.png)

All right， so we've made a decent amount of progress we've tried to compute this area and we've written it out as this limit of the sum。

 the sum is now written entirely in terms of the ends and entirely in terms of the index variable I。

😡。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_52.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_53.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_54.png)

But now I want to figure out， can I actually figure out what this value is going to be。

 do I know what number this is going to be？

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_56.png)

Now the first way I can clean up this formula is note that the sum here depends on the index variable I。

 the sum doesn't depend on the n， so I have a one over n squared here， I have a one over n。

 I can pull all of those ns outside of my summation， in other words。

 I can clean it up and say the limit is n goes to infinity of1 over n cube times this sum from one up to n of I squared。

😡。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_58.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_59.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_60.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_61.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_62.png)

Okay， so what's the sum from  one up to n of I squared？



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_64.png)

Now I'm going to cite a fact for you and I'll put a link in the description of where you can go and find a proof for this。

 but the fact is this that sum， the sum from one up to n of I squared is just equal to this nice expression n times n plus1 times 2 m plus1 all divided about by6 you can prove this with something called mathematical induction it is not really a part of calculus it's sort of an algebra proof。

 so I'm going to pull out this fact for you that we have this here and I'm going to use that。😡。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_66.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_67.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_68.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_69.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_70.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_71.png)

To help me evaluate what I have right here， indeed。

 I can say it's the limit as N goes to infinity of1 over N cubed。

 and now I've just replaced my sum with this result here that I've claimed from my fact。😡。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_73.png)

All right， so let's actually try and compute this limit。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_75.png)

This is a limit that we should know how to do。 It is a polynomial on the top and a polynomial on the bottom and we can ask if we're taking a limit at infinity。

 what's the highest power on the top and the highest power on the bottom The bottom is pretty easy just n cubed and on the top here well there's an n there's an n plus1 and there's a two n plus1 so if I just look at the multiplication of those out。

 the highest power is going to be n cubed and it's coefficient is11 and there's a two here so is a2 n cubed on the top。

😡。

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_77.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_78.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_79.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_80.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_81.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_82.png)

And then factor in in the divided up by 6 that I have what I get is that this is just the limit n goes to infinity of2 n cubed on the top。

6 n cubed on the bottom my end's cubed are going to go away。

 the two over6 last time I checked was just equal to the value of one third。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_84.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_85.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_86.png)

And now we have an answer， this is the first time in the last couple of videos that we've actually managed to figure out what was the area underneath the curve x squared between the point0 and1。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_88.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_89.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_90.png)

And notice that while we were doing rectangle approximations。

 if I use five rectangles or 10 rectangles or 100 rectangles。

 I could compute them all out of my calculator， that would be possible。



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_92.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_93.png)

And you get a value that might be close， but it wouldn't be the exact value。 The claim here。

 the magic of the indefinite integral is that it gives you the exact value that by taking this limit of this particular sum and evaluating it correctly and using some algebraic tricks and going in and evaluate and limit the end。

 it's a bit of a process， but it gets us to an actual number。

 the area under x squared between 0 and 1 is equal to one third。
