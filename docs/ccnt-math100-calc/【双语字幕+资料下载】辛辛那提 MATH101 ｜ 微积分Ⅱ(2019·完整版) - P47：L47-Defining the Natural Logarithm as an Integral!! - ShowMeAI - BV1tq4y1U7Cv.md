# P47ï¼šL47-Defining the Natural Logarithm as an Integral!! - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to see a new way to think about the function logarithm of Xã€‚

 Loarithm of X is a function you may likely have seen in your past inï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 differential calculus coursesã€‚ But in this videoï¼Œ we're going to define the logarithm as a particular type of intervalã€‚

 a particular accumulation functionã€‚ We're going to see that this sort of strange new approach actually has some really nice featuresã€‚

 and we can recover many of the normal properties in a logarithmã€‚

 So let's begin by looking at the old way of doing itï¼Œ which again not by studying the logarithmã€‚

 but by studying the exponential functionã€‚ You know the value of the special number E and we'll talk a little bit more about E later on in the videoã€‚

 then E to the X is something that hopefully you can understandã€‚ For exampleã€‚

 E cubed would be E times E times Eã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ the exponential function is something that I can go ahead and graph and when I graph itã€‚

 it has some really nice propertiesã€‚ For exampleï¼Œ this is an increaseã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

it gets bigger as you go to the rightã€‚What that means is that for any outputï¼Œ any y valueã€‚

 there is exactly one corresponding input corresponding X valueã€‚

 that is this is a socalled one to one functionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd what is nice about one to one functions is that you can invert themã€‚

 And indeedï¼Œ that's what the logarithm wasã€‚ The logarithm of x was defined to be the inverse function to the exponentialã€‚

 what do I mean by thatï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ an inverse function is going to reflect over the line y equal to xã€‚

 So if I plot hereï¼Œ the line y equal to xï¼Œ then logarithm of x is what appears on the bottomã€‚

 that is the reflection around the line y equal to xã€‚

 that is the inverse function to the exponential functionã€‚

So this approach is effectively taking the exponential function is the thing we understandã€‚

 and then defining the logarithm from thatã€‚ This point about inverse is going to be stated in a different wayã€‚

 its definition may be thatï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ the composition of the exponential with the logarithm or the logarithm composed with the exponential that either way you may compose these functionã€‚

 you just get xã€‚ you just get the identity functionã€‚

 This means the same thing as my picture of reflecting over the line y equal xã€‚ Okayã€‚

 so that was the old way of defining the logarithm where you begin with understanding the exponential function and you define the logarithm from thatã€‚

 But now I'm going to introduce a new way of thinking about itã€‚ Here's my definitionã€‚

 I'm going to define the logarithm of x sometimes pronounced line of x or L N of x as the integral from one up to x of some integralgra1 over T Dtã€‚

 This is a definition that applies for values of x greater than0ã€‚ Nowï¼Œ you may have seen thisã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

written downï¼Œ for instanceï¼Œ in calculus 1ï¼Œ but at that timeã€‚

 this equation represented a property of the logarithm function that you've studied beforeï¼Œ indeedã€‚

 if you took the derivative of the logarithm function by the definition of the derivative of the limit definition of the derivativeã€‚

 then you could recover that an antider of1 over x was logarithm of xã€‚

 but now I'm saying this is the definitionï¼Œ this is what I'm defining logarithm of x to beã€‚

For exampleï¼Œ if this is the graph of 1 over xï¼Œ then longerger than of x is just going to look like thisã€‚

Okayï¼Œ how do I interpretï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ let me first begin at this pointï¼Œ logarithm of the value of oneã€‚

 which is just an integral from one up to oneã€‚ The integral from  one up to one is just going to be zero by definitionã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo indeedï¼Œ the logarithm function at the value of one is just zeroã€‚

Then let me suppose I take a value of x that's to the right of this point1ã€‚

So what I'm doing here is I'm doing an integral from1 up to xï¼Œ so if x is to the right of oneã€‚

 it's the area under the curve of that function one over xã€‚

 this is some positive result and so logarithm is some positive resultã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒIf my x is biggerã€‚

 then I have more area under the curve and I get a larger value of logarmã€‚ Similarlyã€‚

 let me now imagine that my x is actually less than the value of  oneã€‚ It's still positiveã€‚

 It's bigger than 0ï¼Œ but it's less than 1ã€‚Wellï¼Œ in that caseï¼Œ an interval from 1 up to xã€‚

 where x is less than1 is read from right to leftã€‚ It introduces therefore a negative sign when you have the smaller value on the top that introduces a negative value in my definition of integrationã€‚

So in this caseï¼Œ the area underneath the curve of 1 over x from 1 to the value of x is a negative valueã€‚

 and indeedï¼Œ if I make my x closer and closer to0ï¼Œ I get a larger and larger negative value for the logarithmã€‚

 So we have this nice property that as the value of x is getting closer to zero from the rightã€‚

 then the logarithm is going to become more and more negativeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo from this definitionã€‚

 the graph of logarithm is something we can understandã€‚

I'll also note that I really like this definition because it's something that we can do approximations forã€‚

 if you want to know a logarithm of 72 bitsï¼Œ for instanceï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 it's the interval from 1 up to 72 of1 over TVTã€‚ and because integration can be well approximated numericallyã€‚

 indeedï¼Œ even the definition of integration was sort of a limit of approximationsã€‚

 And so as a resultï¼Œ there is a nice way to numerically approximate the logarithm of any value using this particular definitionã€‚

Nowï¼Œ one of the nicest features of defining logarithm this way is that we can use the fundamental theorem of calculusã€‚

 So let me look what that saysã€‚ The fundamental theorem of calculus is that the derivative with respect to x and the accumulation function and the accumulation function is an integral from a up to x where a is some number of f of TDt There's a t here in the xã€‚

 the t in the integralgra is just a dummy variable and it ranges between the values of a and xã€‚

 what the fundamental theorem of calculus said is that the derivative of the accumulation function is just the function f evaluated at xã€‚

 So now I can take the derivative of logarithm if I do that if I take the derivative of both sidesã€‚

 then by the fundamental theorem of calculusï¼Œ the derivative of the integral of one over t is just going to become well1 over x So the derivative of logarithm is1 over xã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo one of the things that's so nice about this approach is that we have learned that the logarithm function is differentiable and thus continuous for positive values of xã€‚

 This is actually not trivial when you do the exponential approach that even the fact that the exponential functionã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ is continuous is something that takes some effort to deduceã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Remember that the old approach started with the exponential and then led to the logarithmã€‚

 but I want to go over reverseã€‚Hereï¼Œ I'm going to begin with the logarithmã€‚

 and I'm going to try to plug in the value of Eã€‚ Nowï¼Œ notice what I'm doing hereã€‚

 I don't know what E is at this stage in this formulaã€‚ This is a definition of Eã€‚

 My claim is that E is the number such that the integral from one up to E of one over TD T is equal to 1ã€‚

So E is defined such that this integral is1 indeedã€‚

 this integral at some point is less than one and at some point is more than oneã€‚

 it must be one somewhere in that place where it is oneï¼Œ that is what I will define to be Eã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

This is in contrast to perhaps other ways of defining Eã€‚ you may have seen in the pastã€‚ For exampleã€‚

 in calculus1ï¼Œ this limit definition came about by taking the derivative of a to the x by the limit definition of the derivativeã€‚

 then to assert that the derivative of E to the X was equal to E to the X itselfã€‚ Wellã€‚

 that happened when the base value was equal to this particular limitã€‚

 And that's what that came aboutã€‚ Neverthelessï¼Œ the point is that we have this new definition of Eã€‚

 which comes about from this new definition of the logarithm functionã€‚ Nowï¼Œ as you likely knowã€‚

 there are many different properties of the logarithm functionã€‚

 And one of those properties is that the logarithm of a productã€‚

 logarithm of x times Y is the logarithm of x plus the logarithm of Yã€‚

 This is just one of many different log rulesã€‚ And I want to show you the proof of this log ruleã€‚

 But the proof for the other log rules or somewhat analogousã€‚

 And I would encourage you to try working through them yourselfã€‚ Here's how this proof goesã€‚ Wellã€‚

 by definition of the logarithm functionã€‚ This is just equal to the interval from oneã€‚

To x times y of1 over TDtï¼Œ I'm going to take that integral from 1 up to x times yã€‚

 and I'm going to break it up into actually two different integralsã€‚

The first integral is going to go from 1 all the way up to xã€‚

 and the second goes from that value of x all the way to x times yã€‚

So the entire interval 1 to x times y is broken up into the1 to x and the x to yã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 one of the properties of integrals is that you can break up the domainã€‚

 we call this addivity of domain and indeed a integral over a larger region can be broken up is the sum of two different integrals over a smaller region as long as they mean in the middleã€‚

 It's1 to x and then x to x times y first of these integrals is just the definition of logarithm of xã€‚

 But for the secondï¼Œ I want to apply a change of variablesã€‚

 So I'm going to apply the change of variables U is t divided by xã€‚

 Then what happens if I use that change of variables it gives meï¼Œ wellã€‚

 logarithm of x for the first And then for the secondï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ if u is equal to t over xã€‚

 and t is equal to xï¼Œ then the lower limit of integration just becomes1ã€‚

 And if t is equal to x times y for the upper limit of integrationã€‚

 then that's going to give you just the value of yã€‚ likewiseã€‚

 the integral is going to turn over to one over u duã€‚ What is thisã€‚

I just the same thing as the definition of the logarithm of Yã€‚ So indeedã€‚

 we managed to conclude that the logarithm of the product of x times y is just the logarithm of x plus the logarithm of yã€‚

 So so farï¼Œ we've only defined the logarithm function for positive values of xã€‚

 So what should we do when you have negative values of xã€‚

 And I'm going to begin by suggesting a substitutionï¼Œ which is u is absolute value of Xã€‚

 Now my x going to be positive or negative and my u is going to be positiveã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Then if I want to considerï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ the derivative of logarithm of absolute value of x nowã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ this is just a chain ruleã€‚ It's the derivative of logarithm of uã€‚ And so you doï¼Œ wellã€‚

 the derivative of logarithm of Uï¼Œ which is1 over Uã€‚ But by the chain ruleã€‚

 you multiply that by the derivative of u with respect to xã€‚ So what is thatï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 this is the graph of absolute value of xã€‚ and absolute value of xï¼Œ itss slopeã€‚

 it's derivative is either oneï¼Œ when x is greater than 0ï¼Œ or negative one when x is less than 0ã€‚

 or it does not exist at x equal to 0 itselfã€‚ So the way I capture this one or minus1 for the slopeã€‚

 is to write x over absolute value of xã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ if x is positive like 7ï¼Œ this is just 7 over 7ã€‚

 which is one greatã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒIf x is negative like negative7ï¼Œ this is negative7 over positive7ã€‚

 which is minus1 againï¼Œ greatã€‚So this derivativeï¼Œ of courseï¼Œ and thenï¼Œ of courseã€‚

 this derivative does not exist at the value of x equal to 0ã€‚ Wellã€‚

 absolute value of x is the same thing as x squaredã€‚ So this is x over x squaredã€‚

 which is the same thing as just well 1 divided by xã€‚ and againï¼Œ valid only for x not equal to 0ã€‚

So the logarithm of absolute valueï¼Œ this can be useful because if I want to findï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 an antider to 1 over xã€‚ Wellï¼Œ since1 over x can be positive or negativeã€‚

 it's helpful if you have an answer that has the same domainã€‚

 So logarithm of absolute value of x is a better answer for an antider to1 over x because logarithm of absolute value of x is an antid for all value of x except for x equal to 0ã€‚

 where logarithm of x is an antid only on the restricted domain that x is greater thanã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So I hope you found this interestingï¼Œ new approach to the logarithm function where we define it in terms of an integral to be an interesting one that presents the same basic results that we know like that the logarithm of a product is the sum of two logarithmsã€‚

 But with a bit of a different flair that allows for some easy computationsï¼Œ likeï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 that the logarithm function is differentiable by the fundamental theorem of calculusã€‚
