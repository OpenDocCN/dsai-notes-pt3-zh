# P46ï¼šL46-Why Exponential Growth Intro to Separable Differential Equations - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

What is a differential equationï¼Œ Where do they come fromã€‚

 How do you solve them In this introduction to differential equationsã€‚

 I'm going to focus on one of the simpler classes of these so called differential equations called separable equationsã€‚

 I actually want to begin with the solution to one of them firstï¼Œ namely exponential growthã€‚

Exponential growth is something that we see all around us in natureã€‚ One example of this is wellã€‚

 a pandemicã€‚ This is the graph of coronavirus cases outside of China leading up to March 10ã€‚

 and this is a period before countries were trying different social distancing techniques And as you can seeã€‚

 the number of cases is well modeled by an exponential curveã€‚

 But why exactly is it exponential growth and not just some other type of growth that gets larger as time goes onã€‚

 like for exampleï¼Œ quadratic growth or cubic growthã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And why would the spread of coronavirus be similarï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 to the growth of money in your bank account Hereï¼Œ I imagine I have 100 bucks to invest 5% impressed for 20 yearsã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ the growth of the amount of money in your bank account if it's compounding continuously is also given by an exponential curveã€‚

 So what I want to do in this video is try to describe the socalled differential equations that are going to govern this kind of exponential growthã€‚

 Thisï¼Œ by the wayï¼Œ is the first video in a whole playlist on differential equationsã€‚

 I'll encourage you to check out the link in the descriptionã€‚

 Give the video a like for that YouTube algorithmã€‚ We're all mathematicians hereã€‚ We like algorithmsã€‚

 YouTube like algorithmsï¼Œ it helps the video a lotã€‚ and let's get into the videoã€‚

 So what is a differential equationã€‚ Wellï¼Œ it's an equationã€‚

 But what you're allowed to have in the equation is rates of change of the variable or derivatives of the variableã€‚

 the derivative of why is equal to in this caseï¼Œ three times yã€‚

eququation might relate an independent variable and a dependent variableã€‚

 but it wouldn't have derivatives in themã€‚ A more complicated example could look something like thisã€‚

 It might have second derivativesï¼Œ first derivativesã€‚

 the dependent variable Y and the independent variable T all mixed togetherã€‚

 So I'm going to specifically focus on the top oneã€‚

 The derivative of y is some multiple K previously written 3ã€‚

 but could be any number multiplied by yã€‚Nowï¼Œ why would this differential equation be usefulï¼Ÿ

What's happening on the left side is that I have a rate of change of why that's what a derivative representsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWhereas on the right hand sideï¼Œ I'm claiming that this is proportionalã€‚

 some proportionality constant K just to the variable y itselfã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Imagine the case of my 00 dollars being investedã€‚ The amount of money that I make per unit of timeã€‚

 the rate of change at which I make moneyï¼Œ the growth rateã€‚ Wellã€‚

 it depends on how much money I haveã€‚ If I had  a million dollarsã€‚

 I'd make more money per year at the same interest rate than I wouldã€‚ if I had $100 dollarsã€‚

 So the idea is that the rate of change is therefore proportional to the amount that you actually haveã€‚

 If you start with moreï¼Œ you get a higher rate of change or consider the case of the growth rate of a virusã€‚

If one person is infectedï¼Œ they may go and infectï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 three other people in some unit of timeï¼Œ so the growth rate of the infectionã€‚

 the number of new cases you're going to get per unit of time is just a multiple of the number of infected cases you have alreadyã€‚

So the point of this differential equation is that it captures the idea of growth rates being proportional to the amount you haveã€‚

 And that relationship is something that we see very oftenã€‚

 So now I want to manipulate this equationã€‚ The first thing I'm going to do I'm gonna divide out by this value of Y I'm doing this so that on the left hand sideã€‚

 I have the derivative of y and something that depends on y And on the right hand sideã€‚

 there is nothing that depends on y Then I'm going to go alongã€‚

 and I'm going to take the integral with respect to T of both sidesã€‚

 So the integral of one over y y prime Dt is equal to the integral of Kdtã€‚

 I'm always allowed to do the same thing to both sides of an equationï¼Œ and thereforeã€‚

 I'm going to integrate both sides of this equationã€‚ Now for the left termã€‚

 let me make a substitution I'm going to define the differential Dy to simply be the derivative d Y Dt multiplied by the differential Dt that is I will write this is one over y dã€‚

 This differential dy is just defined to beã€‚you would get from chain ruleï¼Œ the Y prime Dtã€‚

The reason I've done this is that the left integral can now just be thought of some function of yã€‚

 integrated with respect to Yï¼Œ whereas on the rightï¼Œ I have some functionã€‚

 just the function K integrated with respect to Tã€‚If I then evaluate those two integralsã€‚

 one over y integrates to the logarithm of yï¼Œ and the value of K integrates to K Tã€‚

 because these are indefinite intervalsã€‚ I'm going to add a plus C on the right hand sideã€‚

 I could have had two different plus C'sï¼Œ perhaps a C1 and a C2 for each of the intervalsã€‚

 but I'll just combine them into this single plus C on the right hand sideã€‚

My goal now is to solve for yã€‚ and I can do this by taking the exponential of both sidesã€‚ Againã€‚

 I can do the same thing to both sides of an equationã€‚

 So let me raise both sides of the equation E to the powerã€‚

 So E to the logarithm of y and E to the Kt plus Eã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOn the leftã€‚

 this is just going to cancel out and be the absolute value of yã€‚ And on the rightï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 E to the K T plus Cã€‚ And then finallyï¼Œ I'm going to do a little bit of trickery here with that plus Cã€‚

 The first thing I note is that E to the K T plus Eã€‚

 I could separate it and write as an E to the C out the front and then multiply by the E to the K Tã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒBut E to the C is just well some other constant and so I'm going to replace E to the C with the constant A and if I allow a to be negative or positiveã€‚

 that reflects the fact that I had an absolute valueï¼Œ which could be plus or minus as wellã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And we even allow the constant a to be equal to 0 because if you went to the original differential equation and took the derivative of 0 as equal to k times 0ã€‚

 that would have satisfied it as wellã€‚ So in the endã€‚

 I have this Y is a constant A times the E to the Ktã€‚

 So I call this a solution to the differential equationã€‚

 Y equal to A E to the Kt is a solution to itã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ if you just take this y and plug it inã€‚

 It worksã€‚ When you take the derivativeï¼Œ you would get K A E to the Kt is equal to K times A E to the K Tã€‚

 It's the same thing on both sidesã€‚ So it works outã€‚This is calledï¼Œ by the wayã€‚

 an ordinary differential equation or an ODE in multivariable calculusã€‚

 you could have functions that have multiple independent variables and you could take partial derivatives of those and therefore you would get a partial differential equationã€‚

 so there's another category that you can investigate in your futureã€‚

The next thing I want to do is imagine that I impose some conditionã€‚

 Imagine I impose that at time t equal to 0ï¼Œ the value of y is 100ã€‚

 This is called an initial conditionã€‚ It says I'm going to specify one pointã€‚ that at t equal to 0ã€‚

 This is equal to 100ã€‚ Then what I get out of thisã€‚ If I just plug it in is thatï¼Œ wellã€‚

100 is what happens when you plug in t equal to 0ï¼Œ A E to the K times 0ã€‚ and E to the0 was just 1ã€‚

 So this is just give me the value of aã€‚In other wordsã€‚

 my initial condition that y of 0 is 100 tells me what the a isã€‚

 so now I have a more specific solution Y is 100 E to the Kt putting these two different things together gives something called an IVP or an initial value problem and initial value problem is when I have a differential equation together with an initial condition that y of 0 is some specified value why not and what we've managed to drive is that the solution to that differential equation is that y is this constant y not E to the Ktã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo solving this equation is where the exponential growth formulas come fromã€‚

 you begin with a very reasonable relationship that the rate of change is proportional to the quantityã€‚

 which seems reasonable whether it's the growth of a virus or the growth in your bank accountã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then solving that differential equation led to this particular solutionï¼Œ the exponential growthã€‚

 We can do the same basic idea for more general separable equationsã€‚ Considerï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 the followingã€‚I want to have a rate of change DYDTã€‚Is equal to a specific formã€‚

 This is a class of ordinary differential equationsã€‚

 It's the specific form where it can be written as a function of T on the top and a function of Y on the bottomã€‚

 exactly like thatã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒWellï¼Œ if it is of this specialized formã€‚

 then I can just basically do what we did beforeï¼Œ so the first thing I can do is I can move the G of Y overã€‚

That means that on the leftï¼Œ I only have Y and Y prime appearing and on the right I only have T appearingã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen I could integrate both sides of this with respect to Tã€‚

 and this is going to be the integral of G of Yï¼Œ Dy d T dt is equal to the integral of F of TDtã€‚

Making the same definition that DY is going to be the DY DTEã€‚

 I get now an integral in terms of y on the left an integral in terms of T on the rightã€‚

If I then define that capital G of y is an antider to lowercase G of yã€‚

 I define that capital F of T is an anti derivative to lowercase F of Tã€‚

 then I get the equation capital G of y is capital F of T plus that arbitrary constant Cã€‚

This equation that I have down here is my solution to the original differential equationã€‚

 the original separable differential equationï¼Œ Sometimes the G of y is relatively nice as it was in our first exampleã€‚

 and I can solve it explicitly to say that y is this specific function of T and sometimes the G of y is quite messy and I'm not able to do thatã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNeverthelessï¼Œ we have a nice procedure to be able to solve these separable differential equationsã€‚

I hope you enjoyed this introduction to differential equationsã€‚
