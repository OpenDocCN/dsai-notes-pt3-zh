# P46ï¼šL46- Solving for the constant in the general anti-derivative - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

This problem is a little bit interestingã€‚ I am asking not for an and derivativeã€‚

 I'm asking for the and derivative this functionã€‚But I'm asking for the anti derivative that has this property that that the big f of 0 is equal to twoã€‚

 Now the idea here is thisã€‚

If we think about the general antid of this little Fã€‚

 it's going to be some function big F plus an arbitrary constantã€‚

 so there's a whole infinite family of different antids depending on what the value of the constant isã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_3.png)

But by plugging in this number for one of the values of Cã€‚

 you're going to have it that when you plug in 0 is going to be equal to 2ã€‚ In other wordsã€‚

 this claim what the f of0 is equal to 2 is basically going to tell us what that C value has to beã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_5.png)

So let's try to figure out what the general anti derivative is firstã€‚

 and then we'll try to evaluate the Cã€‚

![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_7.png)

So I need to come along here and figure out what my f of x is going to be my capital F of xã€‚

 my and derivative of a little lowercase of F of xã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_9.png)

Nowï¼Œ I know the derivative of E to the x is e to the xã€‚

 So the anti derivative of e to the x is E to the x just the sameã€‚

 So this is first part it's going to be a little bit easyã€‚ That's just going to be E to the Xã€‚

 And then oh my goodnessï¼Œ what's going onï¼Œ One over a square root of1 minus x squaredã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_11.png)

![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_12.png)

Now this is mainly a question of being able to recognize something indeedã€‚

 you might recall that the derivative of arc sine is exactly this expressionï¼Œ In other wordsã€‚

 one over the square root of 1 minus x squared is exactly the derivative of arc sineã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_14.png)

And thereforeï¼Œ the anti derivative of this thing is just going to be arc sign as wellã€‚

 So this is E to the x plusã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒArc sign of Xã€‚

![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_16.png)

And then finallyï¼Œ for the general antiroï¼Œ I'm going to come along and add in that plus C that we have not yet determinedã€‚



![](img/e92ebf4dfc9442cf6d87fa337c63a38b_18.png)

So now comes time to determine thatã€‚ All rightï¼Œ so let's goã€‚

 I want f of0 to be equal to the value of two right that's my claimã€‚

 I want this to be equal to 2 but what is F of0 well E to the zeroã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒPlusã€‚Arc signã€‚Alsoï¼Œ of 0 plus Cã€‚

 Okayï¼Œ I can probably evaluate that E to the 0 with just oneã€‚What about arc signine of zeroï¼ŸWellã€‚

 I know that sine of0 is0ï¼Œ so therefore arc sine of0 is also going to be  zeroã€‚

 so this is going to be  one plus0 plus Cã€‚ And so I have this this one plus C on the right hand side I want it to equal to2 so I need to have one plus something is two I need that C to be the value of oneã€‚

 In other wordsï¼Œ we're saying that the C is going to be equal to oneã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And so that is the anti derivative E to the x plus a sine of x plus c equal to1 will give me something that is both an anti derivative and has this property that f of zero is equal to 2ã€‚

Now this is symmetry between derivatives and antids where there's sort of the unspecified constant C in the anti derivative is actually incredibly importantã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ you know that velocity is the derivative of distanceã€‚

So if I told you exactly what my velocity was at every single point in timeã€‚

 I have this wonderful velocity function prescribed to youã€‚

 you might reasonably ask what is the distanceï¼ŸBut to get from velocity to a distanceã€‚

 you have to go the other way aroundï¼Œ you have to find an anti derivativeã€‚

And so you might have this lovely distant functionï¼Œ but there's gonna to be a plus C in thereã€‚

 you do not know where to start so I can't tell you how far you are away from me just by knowing what your velocity has been all along because I also have to know where it was that you startedã€‚

 how far did you initially start from me in order for me to figure out how how far you eventually ended up to me So this is symmetry is going to be incredibly important in a large number of our applicationsã€‚
