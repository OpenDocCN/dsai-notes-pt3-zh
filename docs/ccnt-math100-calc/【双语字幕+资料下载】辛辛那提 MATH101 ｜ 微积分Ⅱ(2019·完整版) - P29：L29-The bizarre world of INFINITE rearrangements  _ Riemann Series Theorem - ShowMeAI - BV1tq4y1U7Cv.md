I find infinity to be a bit of a slippery concept。 No matter how well， I think I understand it。

 there's always new ways where I find that infinity gives all sorts of interesting and unexpected behaviors。

 In this video， we're gonna to see one such example where infinitefinity comes in and does sort of weird tricks on us。

 It takes a very natural operation interchanging the order of which you add two numbers。

 But when you do it in infinitely large number of times when you do a so calledled infinite rearrangement is's going to cause all sorts of interesting phenomena。

 I'm going start by just adding three different numbers，1 plus 2 plus 3。 And as everyone knows， this。

 well， adds up to 6。😊，But there's an interesting property。

 which is that I could take two of those numbers， and I could interchange them around。

 or I could take another pair of those numbers and interchange them around。

 And it doesn't matter what permutation you do of these numbers。 They always add up to 6。

 This is called the commutivity property of addition。

 means that you can interchange the order and you get the same result。 Now。

 what was important in that example was that there was only three terms。 It was a finite number。

 But if there was infinitely many terms that were all being added up。 For example。

 this series is a geometric series，1 plus a half plus a quarter plus an8 plus a 16th dot dot dot means I keep adding terms like that forever。

 Now， what is this actually add up to。🎼One argument might be that it should add up to infinity because you're adding infinitely many positive terms。

 But then if I look at any individual terms， the terms are getting smaller and smaller and smaller。

1/ quarter 1/8， when 16 and so on。 they're getting smaller。 So yes， I'm adding infinitely many terms。

 but each term is getting smaller and smaller。 Now。

 what I'm going to show you next is that a series like this。

 an infinite sum of terms actually can add up to a number。

 And I can illustrate this by simply walking down my hallway。

 I'm going to walk from here at my door frame。 all the way down to the end where I've drawn a green line。

 But I'm not going to walk down my hallway。 The normal way I'm going to do it in a very special way。

 What I'm going to do is walk exactly half of the distance first。

 So that takes me to somewhere around here。 Let's mark this point with some tape。

 and I'm going to write one half on it to denote that I've walked half down my hallway。

 Then I'm going to walk forward again where I am now traveling half of the remaining。😊。

And let's put another marker that's what I have exactly in half。

Because what I've done here is travel half the distance to the green line and then half the remaining distance。

 what I've really done is traveled one half like I did before。

 but then I also traveled half of a half， which is a quarter。

 so I've traveled one half plus one quarter which is the same thing as three quarters of the total distance。

I'm then going to travel forward again and I want to come to half of the remaining distance。

 so half of the quarter and I'll put down the tape once again at the halfway point。

That is at this line， I'm now at the one half I traveled originally。

 plus one half of the remaining half， which was a quarter and then one half of that remaining quarter which is1/8 and so now I'm at seven8s of the distance to the final green line。

And as you can imagine， I can keep on going with this。Dividing in half once again。

 I am now at 156s of the way there。Then 31， 30 seconds， 63， 64s。127，128。 So putting it all together。

 I started at my doorway。 and then the way I walked down the hallway was first going this distance of a half。

 And then I went half of the remaining distance and then half of the remaining distance and half of the remaining distance。

 half the remaining distance， half the remaining distance until such time as the width of the tape meant I couldn't easily subdivide by half any longer。

 So then my argument is that the series represented by a half plus a quarter plus an 8 plus a 16th and so on。

 that that series adds up to one， In other words， 100% of my original distance。

 So even though I'm taking infinitely many steps， the fact that the distance of those steps at smaller and smaller and smaller in this case results in that series adding up to exactly one。

 Now， we have to return to the problem of rearranging the order of the terms in that series。

 So let's check out a new series Now， one that I call the alternating。😊。

Harmonic series I'm going to do the same type of idea， but I'm gonna add a bit of a fancy pattern。

 I'm going take the number one to start with， but then I'm going to subtract off the value of a half I'm going to add the value of a third and I'm going to subtract off the value of a quarter notice here that it goes plus minus plus minus and then also notice that this is one over one1 over two1 over three and one over4 So for example。

 the next term if I was to keep up the pattern would be plus one fifth and I can keep on going minus16 and so forth。

And now I'm going to imagine this pattern goes on forever。

 I'm going to add a plus dot dot dot to signify it。 This is not a sum。

 but something that we call a mathematics， a series， a series of the sum of infinitely many terms。

 And then you can ask the question， does this sum actually add up to anything。

 And indeed in this case it does。 it's kind of miraculous， this adds up to the logarithm of two。

 I'm going to leave a link in the description that visually explains why that's the case。

 but for our purposes， I want to just note that we have this infinite series。

 a sum of infinitely many terms that converges， or in other words， adds up to a specific value。

 The idea of convergence here is that as I add more and more terms that the sum that I get from taking。

 for example， the first 10 terms， the first hundred terms。

 the first billion terms gets closer and closer and closer the value of logarithm of  two。

 So now I want to try rearranging this infinite series。

 I'm going get rid of the equals logarithm of two for a moment and just play around with the terms that I have。

😊，So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm actually going to leave the one and the one half by itself。

 I'm not really going to touch that at all and then I'm going to put the one third away for a moment and sort of leave the minus quarter that is I'm taking the one third and moving it a little bit later and actually let's move all this down and give myself a little bit of space。

😡，Now I'm going to add that one third back in， so I'm going to come here and I'm going to take the onet and the-16 and I'm going to put them together。

 So really all this happened is that the onet has moved over and then the one fifthth is also being moved over。

 I haven't put that one in yet because I had a minus quarter by itself。

 I'm going to add a minus18 by itself。 and then I'm going to come together and put the plus 1 fifth and the minus110th。

I'm then going to have the minus18 all by itself so there's a little bit of a pattern here This is one and then half that value one third and then half that value one fifth and then on half that value likewise for these individual one one quarter18 minus112 so even though I don't have all the things I need to put this in you can imagine the next one would be plus17 I actually do have that one but then immediately followed by a minus114th and I just didn't put out enough of them so I'm just gonna to put these ones away and I'm gonna put my dot dot dot up there so that the pattern continues okay so it's all the same terms a few more hidden in the dot dot dot but I' just rearrange them it's a different order okay well let me do a little bit of math on this。

If I put the one and the minus1 half together， that these two come together and give me the value just of one half。

I then have the value of minus one quarter。I have the one third and the minus16。

 which is the same thing as plus16， so I'm going to write a plus16。

I then have the minus18 that16 came from two different things come together。

 the minus18 came from just one thing， the plus five and minus1/10th those are both together。

 they're going to add up to plus one/10， so I'll write one/10。

I then have this minus 1 12 and so forth。All right， so let me do one final computation here。

 which is if I look at this series in the middle， which was basically ta by first rearranging the top and then clustering them together。

 taking all these pairs and adding them up into a single number。

This is actually a half of what I began with。 So this result that I have here is one half of， well。

 one half of one， and then minus one half， then plus1， third，-1，4， plus 1， fifth，-1，6。And so forth。

That is， if you ignore the one half that was out the front。

 this is just the original series that we started with。

 that is when I just rearranged the original series。

 it became half the value of the original series and so what is this going to be equal to well。

 one half of logarithm of two。😡，And so half of that adds up to half of logarithm of two。

Isn't that weird， we have this series that added up to log runm of the two。

 but just by changing the order of the terms in that series。

 it now added up to half the value of the log runm of the two。

And it actually turns out that for series like this one for this alternating harmonic series that they can add up to any value that you wish by reordering the terms。

 they can even diverge to plus or minus infinity。 Okay。

 so we're gonna to see how that works in a moment But our question for right now is given a series。

 how do I know whether I am allowed to rearrange terms， and it will always add up to the same thing。

 or that I can't rearrange terms。 And when I do rearrange terms it's going to give a different value。

 Now， I'm actually to tell you about two different theorems related to this idea of infinite rearrangements。

 and it depends on exactly what type of infinite sum we're talking about。

 So first definition is the notion of absolutely converget。

 we're going to say that a series converges absolutely if whenever you take all the terms。

 if you were to put absolutely values around each of the individual terms that is make everything positive regardlesss whether it's negative or positive。

 that it still converges， if that's the case， it converges absolutely。

If you haven't seen this notation before， by the way。

 this sort of fancy sigma notation with an any equal one at the bottom and an infinity at the top。

 it just means take the sum of the terms that we denote by a subM so this is a very strong notion of convergence and then there's a different notion of convergence called conditional convergence。

😡，And the idea of conditional convergence is that perhaps when you wrap all the terms with absolute value signs and make them all positive。

 then it does diverge， but if you hadn't done that。

 then it would converge if those two properties are the case。

 then we call it conditional convergence。And the idea here is that with conditional convergence now the idea here is that absolute convergence is a stronger property than conditional convergence Indeed。

 if you have some terms that are positive and some terms that are negative。

 you get all sorts of cancellation in the infinite sum however with absolute convergence where you make every single term individually positive you're saying there can be no cancellation so it's quite possible that a series would diverge if you put absolute value signs and get rid of that internal cancellation but otherwise it would still converge and indeed the example we're talking about in this video that is one of those examples。

 the alternating harmonic series， the one minus a half plus a third minus a quarter and so forth this series converges to the value of logarithm of two and again the link for why that's the cases down in the description。

But if I was to put absolute value signs everywhere。

 well then my minuss would just turn into pluses I'd have one plus a half plus a third plus a quarter。

 Everything will be plus This is called not the alternating harmonic series， but the harmonic series。

 Actually I have a video about the series and in that video I've explained that this is going to diverge to infinity。

 So I'll put that down in the description as well。 So the point is that the alternating harmonic series with pluses of minuses is an example of a conditionally convergent series。

 Okay so now what are our theorems， there's two of them as I've mentioned。

 The first theorem is about absolute convergence。 It says if you have a series that converges absolutely。

 then it doesn't matter。 you can rearrange the terms to your heart content it will never affect the convergent they will always still converge and they'll still converge to the exact same value。

😊，So this is really nice if you have the strong condition of absolute convergence。

 just rearrange whatever you want to do that's totally fine。

 but if you only have conditional convergence， then you can actually rearrange it to not only change the value but to get to any value you wish that is whether it's a0。

 whether it's pi， whether it's a billion you can always find some rearrangement that adds up to that value so that means that conditionally convergt series are really really interesting because their rearrangements really matter and in fact you can rearrange it in a way to add up to whatever you like。

So I really want to dive a bit more into why this theorem2 is true so first of all Im can imagine I had some series and I just color code it some of the terms are yellow。

 I just mean to denote those are positive terms， some of the terms are blue which means that they're negative terms so I'm always adding terms but the individual terms might be positive or negative。

So I need some new notation to just pull out all of the positive terms or all of the negative terms I want to talk about those two things separately so the way I want to do this is I refer to something called AN plus and the way I want this AN plus to work is that if the term is positive it just gives a positive value and if the term is negative it gives zero and one little trick to being able to do this is to write A plus the absolute value of AN divided by two。

The reason it works so well is okay， imagine A is positive， then it A plus A again。

 which is twice an divided by  two， which is just A。 But if A is negative。

 then the absolute value makes it positive and that numerator would add up to0。

 So this is just equal to A， whenever n gives a term that's positive。

 and then it's equal to zero otherwise。 Likewise， I can pull out the negative terms。

 So A minus just this difference and again， it's going to be the value of A when you get a negative term and then it's going be zero for the positive cases。

 So really what I've developed here is a way to isolate the positive terms in the sequence in the way they isolate the negative terms in the sequence。

 Now， imagine you have that conditionally convergent series。

 the case when you have all the weird things where rearrangements are going to be problematic。 Well。

 in that case， you get the following result。 for these conditionally convergent series。

 the positive terms， if you just look at the positive terms， they add up to positive infinity。

 they divert。 and that the negative terms， if you only look at the negative terms are going to diverge as well。

 but now to minus infinity。😊，The argument here is that because the series converges conditionally that is it doesn't converge absolutely if you just had the positive terms adding up to a number and the negative terms adding up to some other number。

 then the sum of those two would add up to a number and even if you made the negative ones all positive it would just add up to a number so in other words it wouldn't be conditionally convergent so nevertheless you have these positive terms go into infinity these negative terms going to infinity and because conditionally convergent they add in a way that sort of cancels and makes them add up to a specific number if it's conditionally convergent okay so now the argument for why a conditionally convergent series can add up to any number。

Choose your favorite number， maybe you'll choose the value of 100。

Then the way this works is if I only look at the positive terms。

 I could keep on adding positive terms and we said they diver to infinity so the positive terms are eventually going to be bigger than the value of 100 so that is I'm rearranging my series I'm getting rid of all the negative terms for a moment only adding positive terms until I finally get bigger than the value of 100。

😡，Then I'm going to start adding negative terms， I'll add the first negative term。

 the second negative term， I'll add as many of the negative terms as I need until now I'm finally less than 100 once again。

So in other words， I did a bunch of positives， and then I did a bunch of negatives。

 I went bigger than 100 and now I'm less than 1009 me go bigger than 100 again。

 I'll start adding the next positive term that we haven't included and I'll keep on adding those positive terms until we're once again bigger than 100 then I'll start subtracting terms or adding the negative terms。

 whenever ones I haven't yet used yet starting at the beginning until I finally get less than 100 So go bigger than 100 less than 100 bigger than 100 less than 100 adding positive terms and negative terms respectively But because the individual terms are getting smaller and smaller and smaller does converge conditionally after all it means that this back and forth oscillation over the value of 100 is getting closer and closer and closer to 100 And so it converges to 100 and this really is just a rearrangement I haven't delete any terms every term eventually is used I do the first bunch of positives and the first bunch of negatives and the next bunch of positives and the next bunch of negatives and so eventually I will hit every single term in the series it is just a rearrangement。

😊，The same argument works for saying that it must add up to root2 or that it adds up to negative root2 or up to negative a trillion。

 whatever number you like。 And so that's the argument about how a conditionally convergent series。

 like， for example， the alternating harmonic series that we saw earlier in the video can actually add up to any possible value。

 All right， I hope you enjoyed that exploration into infinite rearrangements of infinite series。

 If you enjoy this video， give it a like YouTube like algorithms just as much as us mathematicians do。
