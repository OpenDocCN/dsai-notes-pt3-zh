Let's recall back to when we were doing limits， but I know I know you thought you we were done with limits。

 you thought that was a thing of the past， we were on derivatives and their limits were going to be banished to the ends of the earth。

 but no， because now that we know derivatives， we can do some stuff about limit that we were never able to do before we had the machinery and the sophistication of derivatives so I want to return you to a problem where I'm taking a limit。

And it's some function divided out by another function and what we get is one of these so-called indeterminate forms。

 zero divided by zero or infinity divided by infinity。

 something where we can't just look at it and know the answer For example。

 if you have zero divided by seven， you know that that's zero if you have seven divided by infinity。

 you know that that is going to be zero So there's all sorts of forms that are known。

 but some of them like zero over0 and infinity over infinity。

 we can't just guess based on only looking at the top in the bottom So how do we deal with this in the past Well in the past。

 we did algebra。 In fact， it was a whole bunch of different things we sometimes rationalize sometimes times find lowest common denominators we do some factoring we had all of these old algebra of tricks to resolve the question of indeterminate forms。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_9.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_10.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_11.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_12.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_13.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_14.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_15.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_16.png)

Now what we're going to see in this video was something called Loppy towel's rule and Loppy towel's rule is like the sledgehammer of Calalculus。

 it cracks open a huge category of limits and indeed a ton of the limits that we've done in the past you're now going to be able to do them via Loppy towels rule quite a bit easier。

 but more importantly， there's going to be this whole class of limits that we couldn't do in the past that now we can do because of Loppy towelows rule。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_18.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_19.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_20.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_21.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_22.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_23.png)

So let's consider one example of this， I want to consider the limit as x goes to infinity of the function x divided by e to the power of x。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_25.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_26.png)

Now if I just sort of think about this naively， on the top。

 it's an infinity right x goes to infinity of x is just infinity， and then e to the x。

 I remember that e to the x is one of these graphs that's going to also go up to infinity as x goes to infinity。

😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_28.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_29.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_30.png)

So this really looks to me to be sort of naively of the form infinity divided by infinity。

 that is my so called form。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_32.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_33.png)

Now if I actually go and graph this， it's going to look a little something like this here we have my exponential EDVx and here I have my linear function X。

😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_35.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_36.png)

And they both go off to infinity， but you see how the linear one goes sort of straight up and that the exponential one curves up。

 it goes off to infinity， but way， way， way， way faster than just the function X。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_38.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_39.png)

So sort of the idea is that yes， they're both going to infinity。

 but the EDDS totally dominates just the x， and so it's going to drag it down to zero way faster than the x is going to pull it up to infinity。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_41.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_42.png)

Now I want to try to formalize that process here is going to be what Loppyitals rules tells us。

 it says that if I have one of these indeterminate forms the zero over zero or the infinity over infinity。

 that's what we have in this case。😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_44.png)

Then the limit of a quotient of things is the same thing as the limit where I take the derivative of F on the top and the derivative of G on the bottom。

And then the hope is that somehow taking these derivatives is going to make the limit easier to do。

 Okay， so let's see how this is going to work。 We have this specific example right here。

 And what we're going to say is that this is equal to the limit。As X goes to infinity。

 that doesn't change where I have my functions， and I say it's the same thing where if I take the derivative of both of them。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_46.png)

let's see how it goes， derivative of x is just one derivative of e to the x， this is e to the x。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_48.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_49.png)

And now what I want you to notice is when it's written in one over E to the X， I can do that limit。

 It's no longer a determinant。 It's going to be a one over infinity on the bottom。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_51.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_52.png)

But it's only one on the top， it's not enough to pull it up to infinity。

 So one divided by very large numbers， very small numbers。

 I sort of use my shorthand kind of bad notation， but that's all right。

 we get the idea that it's going to zero。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_54.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_55.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_56.png)

So Loel's rule has given us to something we could maybe look at graphically a little intuitively and try to figure out that E to the x grows faster than x。

 but because of the application of this rule where I take the derivative of the top divided by the derivative of the bottom we can show it directly Allright so that was lovely。

 What happens if we change the x to an x squared now it's x squared on the top and e to the x on the bottom。

 and I can bring up my graph here and now it's not quite so obvious。 This is the e to the x。

 This is the x squared。 they're both sort of turning up towards infinity。

 and it is not completely obvious， maybe it's the case that they cross at some point。

 maybe it's that the e to the x always stays bigger。

 It's not immediately obvious at least from this little portion of the graph。😡。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_58.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_59.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_60.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_61.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_62.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_63.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_64.png)

But we can apply Lopiital's rule， indeed， this is saying that we've got an infinity on the top and an infinity on the bottom。

 they both divert to infinity。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_66.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_67.png)

So then if I want to be able to compute out what this is going to be， well。

 I can take the derivativeto on the top and divide it out by the bottom。

 so this is going to be the limit。😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_69.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_70.png)

As S goes to infinity， that part isn't changing， but then it's a 2 x on the top。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_72.png)

And divide it out E derivative e to the x is just e to the X that doesn't change， so it goes to this。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_74.png)

Because was that helpful， well， it's still infinity over infinity，2 x divrgted to infinity。

 E to the x divrgted to infinity is infinity over infinity。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_76.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_77.png)

However， because it's infinity over infinity iss still in a determinative form I can apply Lotail rule to it a second time so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to come along here and I'm going to say that this is going to be equal to the limit。

😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_79.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_80.png)

As x goes to infinity of the derivative of 2 x is just 2 the derivative of e to the x。

 Well derivative e to the x is just itself， it's e to the x。

 and now is is no longer an indeterminate form as' determinate form。

 it's a single number two on the top divided by something diverging to infinity that's going to bring it all the way down to0。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_82.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_83.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_84.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_85.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_86.png)

So the way I can think about both of these examples is that。

E to the x dominates the growth of x squared。 Yeah， they， they grow。 but， but E to the x grows way。

 way， way， way faster， such that the ratio between them， the x squared divided by the ED x。

 it's going to be going to 0， which represents just how fast it is that the E to the x is growing。

By the way， this idea that we've done through， you could repeat it for x cubed x to the fourth。

 x to the million if you have x to the million， yeah。

 you're going to have to go ahead and use your laitals rule over and over and over and over and over again。

 but eventually that x to the million is going to get down to a constant and so it's going to go to zero。

😡。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_88.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_89.png)

So here's the point， EDVX， it dominates every single polynomial you can imagine x to any power。

 EDVX is going to grow faster than that， it grows enormously quickly， faster than any polynomial。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_91.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_92.png)

The standard indeterminate forms are0 over 0 in infinity over infinity。 But in fact。

 there's many of them。 Let's consider this one。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_94.png)

As long as they think about it limit with brackets of this entire expression that this is the form infinity minus infinity。

 the E to the x， it's going to blow up to positive infinity。

 the x squared that that's going to blow up to positive infinity。 So it's infinity minus infinity。

 Well， what's that。 We don't know。 That's another indeterminate form。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_96.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_97.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_98.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_99.png)

Now I want to use Lo Bo' rule， but Lo Ba rule was about a quotient an f on the top and a G on the bottom。

 So what I want to do is a little bit of algebraic trickery to turn it into that form。

 So what I'm going to say is that this is the same thing as。😡。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_101.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_102.png)

The limit is x goes to infinity， I'm not doing anything there， just changing it around。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_104.png)

And then I'm going to take the e to the x， and I'm going to make it like this。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_106.png)

X squared times E to the x divided by x squared。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_108.png)

You see what I've done this。 the multiplying on the top and the bottom by x squared allows me to factor it out。

 And then I can put a -1 here， because if I went and distributed。

 I'd get the x squared that I have up there。 Well， now that I've done this algebraic trickery。

 What's happened is that we've got something that is applicable to Loppy towels rule。

 We've already done this E to the x divided by x squared。 We know that I diverges to infinity。

 That's something we already did by Loppy towels rule。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_110.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_111.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_112.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_113.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_114.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_115.png)

In which case this entire thing， oh I'm changing this by is subtracting off one。

 so this is also going to be going to infinity。

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_117.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_118.png)

And then finally， I've got an x squared out the frontier。

 and this part is going to be going into infinity as well as x gets large x squared for sure gets large。



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_120.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_121.png)

So what really is this product？Something going to infinity times something else going to infinity。

 the product of two things both going to positive infinity is indeed positive infinity and of course。

 the key to this was the fact that we'd already done the E to the X divided by x squared we'd already use Lopppi towels rule so that this algebraic trickery was really just for the point of making it look like something that we've previously done our Lopppi towels rule to。
