# P39ï¼šL39- Using L'Hopital's Rule to show that exponentials dominate polynomials - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Let's recall back to when we were doing limitsï¼Œ but I know I know you thought you we were done with limitsã€‚

 you thought that was a thing of the pastï¼Œ we were on derivatives and their limits were going to be banished to the ends of the earthã€‚

 but noï¼Œ because now that we know derivativesï¼Œ we can do some stuff about limit that we were never able to do before we had the machinery and the sophistication of derivatives so I want to return you to a problem where I'm taking a limitã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_6.png)

And it's some function divided out by another function and what we get is one of these so-called indeterminate formsã€‚

 zero divided by zero or infinity divided by infinityã€‚

 something where we can't just look at it and know the answer For exampleã€‚

 if you have zero divided by sevenï¼Œ you know that that's zero if you have seven divided by infinityã€‚

 you know that that is going to be zero So there's all sorts of forms that are knownã€‚

 but some of them like zero over0 and infinity over infinityã€‚

 we can't just guess based on only looking at the top in the bottom So how do we deal with this in the past Well in the pastã€‚

 we did algebraã€‚ In factï¼Œ it was a whole bunch of different things we sometimes rationalize sometimes times find lowest common denominators we do some factoring we had all of these old algebra of tricks to resolve the question of indeterminate formsã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_16.png)

Now what we're going to see in this video was something called Loppy towel's rule and Loppy towel's rule is like the sledgehammer of Calalculusã€‚

 it cracks open a huge category of limits and indeed a ton of the limits that we've done in the past you're now going to be able to do them via Loppy towels rule quite a bit easierã€‚

 but more importantlyï¼Œ there's going to be this whole class of limits that we couldn't do in the past that now we can do because of Loppy towelows ruleã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_18.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_19.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_20.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_21.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_22.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_23.png)

So let's consider one example of thisï¼Œ I want to consider the limit as x goes to infinity of the function x divided by e to the power of xã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_25.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_26.png)

Now if I just sort of think about this naivelyï¼Œ on the topã€‚

 it's an infinity right x goes to infinity of x is just infinityï¼Œ and then e to the xã€‚

 I remember that e to the x is one of these graphs that's going to also go up to infinity as x goes to infinityã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_28.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_29.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_30.png)

So this really looks to me to be sort of naively of the form infinity divided by infinityã€‚

 that is my so called formã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_32.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_33.png)

Now if I actually go and graph thisï¼Œ it's going to look a little something like this here we have my exponential EDVx and here I have my linear function Xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_35.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_36.png)

And they both go off to infinityï¼Œ but you see how the linear one goes sort of straight up and that the exponential one curves upã€‚

 it goes off to infinityï¼Œ but wayï¼Œ wayï¼Œ wayï¼Œ way faster than just the function Xã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_38.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_39.png)

So sort of the idea is that yesï¼Œ they're both going to infinityã€‚

 but the EDDS totally dominates just the xï¼Œ and so it's going to drag it down to zero way faster than the x is going to pull it up to infinityã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_41.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_42.png)

Now I want to try to formalize that process here is going to be what Loppyitals rules tells usã€‚

 it says that if I have one of these indeterminate forms the zero over zero or the infinity over infinityã€‚

 that's what we have in this caseã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_44.png)

Then the limit of a quotient of things is the same thing as the limit where I take the derivative of F on the top and the derivative of G on the bottomã€‚

And then the hope is that somehow taking these derivatives is going to make the limit easier to doã€‚

 Okayï¼Œ so let's see how this is going to workã€‚ We have this specific example right hereã€‚

 And what we're going to say is that this is equal to the limitã€‚As X goes to infinityã€‚

 that doesn't change where I have my functionsï¼Œ and I say it's the same thing where if I take the derivative of both of themã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_46.png)

let's see how it goesï¼Œ derivative of x is just one derivative of e to the xï¼Œ this is e to the xã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_48.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_49.png)

And now what I want you to notice is when it's written in one over E to the Xï¼Œ I can do that limitã€‚

 It's no longer a determinantã€‚ It's going to be a one over infinity on the bottomã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_51.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_52.png)

But it's only one on the topï¼Œ it's not enough to pull it up to infinityã€‚

 So one divided by very large numbersï¼Œ very small numbersã€‚

 I sort of use my shorthand kind of bad notationï¼Œ but that's all rightã€‚

 we get the idea that it's going to zeroã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_54.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_55.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_56.png)

So Loel's rule has given us to something we could maybe look at graphically a little intuitively and try to figure out that E to the x grows faster than xã€‚

 but because of the application of this rule where I take the derivative of the top divided by the derivative of the bottom we can show it directly Allright so that was lovelyã€‚

 What happens if we change the x to an x squared now it's x squared on the top and e to the x on the bottomã€‚

 and I can bring up my graph here and now it's not quite so obviousã€‚ This is the e to the xã€‚

 This is the x squaredã€‚ they're both sort of turning up towards infinityã€‚

 and it is not completely obviousï¼Œ maybe it's the case that they cross at some pointã€‚

 maybe it's that the e to the x always stays biggerã€‚

 It's not immediately obvious at least from this little portion of the graphã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_58.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_59.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_60.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_61.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_62.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_63.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_64.png)

But we can apply Lopiital's ruleï¼Œ indeedï¼Œ this is saying that we've got an infinity on the top and an infinity on the bottomã€‚

 they both divert to infinityã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_66.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_67.png)

So then if I want to be able to compute out what this is going to beï¼Œ wellã€‚

 I can take the derivativeto on the top and divide it out by the bottomã€‚

 so this is going to be the limitã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_69.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_70.png)

As S goes to infinityï¼Œ that part isn't changingï¼Œ but then it's a 2 x on the topã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_72.png)

And divide it out E derivative e to the x is just e to the X that doesn't changeï¼Œ so it goes to thisã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_74.png)

Because was that helpfulï¼Œ wellï¼Œ it's still infinity over infinityï¼Œ2 x divrgted to infinityã€‚

 E to the x divrgted to infinity is infinity over infinityã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_76.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_77.png)

Howeverï¼Œ because it's infinity over infinity iss still in a determinative form I can apply Lotail rule to it a second time so that's what I'm going to do I'm going to come along here and I'm going to say that this is going to be equal to the limitã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_79.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_80.png)

As x goes to infinity of the derivative of 2 x is just 2 the derivative of e to the xã€‚

 Well derivative e to the x is just itselfï¼Œ it's e to the xã€‚

 and now is is no longer an indeterminate form as' determinate formã€‚

 it's a single number two on the top divided by something diverging to infinity that's going to bring it all the way down to0ã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_82.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_83.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_84.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_85.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_86.png)

So the way I can think about both of these examples is thatã€‚

E to the x dominates the growth of x squaredã€‚ Yeahï¼Œ theyï¼Œ they growã€‚ butï¼Œ but E to the x grows wayã€‚

 wayï¼Œ wayï¼Œ way fasterï¼Œ such that the ratio between themï¼Œ the x squared divided by the ED xã€‚

 it's going to be going to 0ï¼Œ which represents just how fast it is that the E to the x is growingã€‚

By the wayï¼Œ this idea that we've done throughï¼Œ you could repeat it for x cubed x to the fourthã€‚

 x to the million if you have x to the millionï¼Œ yeahã€‚

 you're going to have to go ahead and use your laitals rule over and over and over and over and over againã€‚

 but eventually that x to the million is going to get down to a constant and so it's going to go to zeroã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_88.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_89.png)

So here's the pointï¼Œ EDVXï¼Œ it dominates every single polynomial you can imagine x to any powerã€‚

 EDVX is going to grow faster than thatï¼Œ it grows enormously quicklyï¼Œ faster than any polynomialã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_91.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_92.png)

The standard indeterminate forms are0 over 0 in infinity over infinityã€‚ But in factã€‚

 there's many of themã€‚ Let's consider this oneã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_94.png)

As long as they think about it limit with brackets of this entire expression that this is the form infinity minus infinityã€‚

 the E to the xï¼Œ it's going to blow up to positive infinityã€‚

 the x squared that that's going to blow up to positive infinityã€‚ So it's infinity minus infinityã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ what's thatã€‚ We don't knowã€‚ That's another indeterminate formã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_96.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_97.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_98.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_99.png)

Now I want to use Lo Bo' ruleï¼Œ but Lo Ba rule was about a quotient an f on the top and a G on the bottomã€‚

 So what I want to do is a little bit of algebraic trickery to turn it into that formã€‚

 So what I'm going to say is that this is the same thing asã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_101.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_102.png)

The limit is x goes to infinityï¼Œ I'm not doing anything thereï¼Œ just changing it aroundã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_104.png)

And then I'm going to take the e to the xï¼Œ and I'm going to make it like thisã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_106.png)

X squared times E to the x divided by x squaredã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_108.png)

You see what I've done thisã€‚ the multiplying on the top and the bottom by x squared allows me to factor it outã€‚

 And then I can put a -1 hereï¼Œ because if I went and distributedã€‚

 I'd get the x squared that I have up thereã€‚ Wellï¼Œ now that I've done this algebraic trickeryã€‚

 What's happened is that we've got something that is applicable to Loppy towels ruleã€‚

 We've already done this E to the x divided by x squaredã€‚ We know that I diverges to infinityã€‚

 That's something we already did by Loppy towels ruleã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_110.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_111.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_112.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_114.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_115.png)

In which case this entire thingï¼Œ oh I'm changing this by is subtracting off oneã€‚

 so this is also going to be going to infinityã€‚

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_117.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_118.png)

And then finallyï¼Œ I've got an x squared out the frontierã€‚

 and this part is going to be going into infinity as well as x gets large x squared for sure gets largeã€‚



![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_120.png)

![](img/e2175ac12894e6323dc0133aa645827f_121.png)

So what really is this productï¼ŸSomething going to infinity times something else going to infinityã€‚

 the product of two things both going to positive infinity is indeed positive infinity and of courseã€‚

 the key to this was the fact that we'd already done the E to the X divided by x squared we'd already use Lopppi towels rule so that this algebraic trickery was really just for the point of making it look like something that we've previously done our Lopppi towels rule toã€‚
