# P26ï¼šL26-Limit Comparison Test for Series - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In the last videoï¼Œ we saw the comparison test for seriesã€‚

 And what we would do is we'd look at a series like this that was complicatedã€‚

 We'd set the A N to be the expressions that we were talking aboutã€‚

 and we would compare it to something easier in this exampleã€‚

 we compared it to a B N that was just going be a one over2 and squaredã€‚

 That was a series that we knew converge by the P testã€‚

 And because the bigger one converge the Bn converges the smaller oneï¼Œ the A N converges as wellã€‚

 The comparison test was pretty niceã€‚ But what if I just make it a small little twistã€‚

 I'm going instead consider in my second exampleã€‚ same exact thingã€‚

 except it' now a plus on the top and a minus on the bottomã€‚ So let's try to use comparison testã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ what we can doã€‚ Let's maybe establish the A Nã€‚ Okayï¼Œ that's easyã€‚

 But now the inequality flipsã€‚ Now it's not less than the B N that's aboveã€‚ It's greater than that Bã€‚

 N that was aboveã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒBut this doesn't tell me anything at allã€‚I'm at home editingã€‚

 And I just realized that what I'm about to say was completely backwardã€‚

 So let me try it one more timeã€‚ If the B Nï¼Œ which is now the smaller seriesï¼Œ if that convergesã€‚

 wellï¼Œ that tells me nothing at all about the A Nï¼Œ which is bigger than thatã€‚

 If something is bigger than a convergent thingï¼Œ it may converge or it may divergeã€‚ Okayã€‚

 that was betterã€‚ So this method of using the comparison test down here just doesn't workã€‚

 So what can we doï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ we're gonna come up with a new theorem called the limit comparison testã€‚

 It's gonna do a better job for usã€‚ Let's consider this seriesã€‚

 I still like that A N and that B N that I hadã€‚ So let's me still keep them up on the boardã€‚

 It's just it's not an inequality that works in the right direction between themã€‚

So instead of trying to set up an inequalityï¼Œ I'm going to consider the limit of this quotient the ANs over the Bnsã€‚

 That isï¼Œ I'm going to consider the limit as n goes to infinity of where I put the expression for the AN on the top and the expression for the Bn on the bottomã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNowï¼Œ I can just do a little bit of algebra hereã€‚ The one over n squared on the bottomã€‚

 I'm going to bring it up to the top is's going to multiply outã€‚

 This is gives me a limit now of 2 n cubed plus 2 on the top and 2 n cubed minus n squared on the bottomã€‚

 How do we do this limitï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ highest power on the topï¼Œ highest power on the bottomã€‚

 They're both the sameã€‚ They're both n cubedã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe smaller order terms don't matter in my limit as N goes to infinityã€‚

 So it's just a 2 n cube dominating over a2 n cube that cancelsã€‚ And I'm just left with oneã€‚

 So this limit of the quotient of my terms is nothing but oneã€‚ Wellï¼Œ what can we do with thatï¼Œ Likeã€‚

 if I have this factï¼Œ this limit of this quotient is equal to oneã€‚ how is this helpfulã€‚

 Now if I didn't have the limit signed thereã€‚ You could pull up the B Nã€‚

 And you say A N was equal to Bnï¼Œ in which case the two series would be identicalã€‚ Nowã€‚

 it's not the case that the A N is equal to Bnï¼Œ they are differentã€‚

 it's only their quotient in the limit that happens to be equal to1ã€‚

 But because of this limiting factorï¼Œ it's enough to think of it that the A Nã€‚

 well not necessarily equal to the Bnã€‚ The A N gets very similar to the Bnã€‚

 And as your N goes to infinityï¼Œ the A N and the B N get closer and closer and closer togetherã€‚

 So it seems very reasonable that the sum of the A Ns and the sum of the Bnsï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 maybe not conversion to the same thingï¼Œ they eitherã€‚Converge or they both divergeã€‚ more formallyã€‚

 we can state the limit comparison testã€‚ It looks like thisã€‚ It says if you've got a series of Ansã€‚

 a series of Bnsï¼Œ they both have positive terms and doesn't need to be equal to oneã€‚

 if the limit of the quotient of those terms is just any positive number could be2 could be a half whatever just needs to be nonzeã€‚

 but it needs to be a finite numberã€‚ Then both series either converge or both series divergeã€‚

 They have to have the same kind of behaviorã€‚ let's return to the example that we haveã€‚

 So where we had this sumã€‚ We had this an N picked out this Bn picked outã€‚

 and we knew that the quotient of themï¼Œ which nothing but oneã€‚ Nowã€‚

 because the Bns are going to converge that something that we have by the P test that we've seen beforeã€‚

 the integral of1 over x squared from one to infinity convergesã€‚

Then what the limit comparison test tells us is that since one of them converges and they are limitedã€‚

 the quotient is oneï¼Œ the other one is going to converge as wellã€‚

 and we get this result by the limit comparison testã€‚

So I really like the limit comparison test in particularã€‚

 because it now applies in scenarios where the comparison test fails where you can't come up with some niceã€‚

 easy inequalityï¼Œ where it works in the wrong directionã€‚ In many of those scenariosã€‚

 the limit comparison test can come in and actually solve whether you've got your convergentã€‚

 So for all of these series with really messy expressionsã€‚ you just sayï¼Œ lookã€‚

 it behaves very similarly to this one with nice expressionã€‚ Maybe it's a P seriesã€‚

 Maybe it's a geometric seriesã€‚ Maybe it's a harmonic seriesã€‚

 It's something you know and you compare it to thatã€‚

 And if the limit is a finite number that's greater than zeroï¼Œ then you have itã€‚

 You have the comparison such that the convergences are going to be the sameã€‚

 The both converge or they both diverã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚
