Here is a slightly different graph， and I want to try to figure out what limits might mean in this case。

This has a very interesting problem at x equal to 1。Notice that if I'm coming from the left here。

 so I'm going along， I'm going along and then my values get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger and what I mean by this。

 I can't draw all the space， but I mean that it just spikes up here heading off towards infinity and then if I come from the right here is coming down down down down and sort of going down towards minus infinity。

😡，And then at the actual point of x equal to 1， this function isn't even defined。

 it's not like f of1 is some number。So I want to be able to talk about the limits for this particular graph so the first one is I want to look at the limit one is the clear spot that's interesting。

 all the other ones， for example， I want to know what the limit was is it got close to 0。5。

 I'd be like that's 0。5 it's just whatever that height is the limit's not that interesting when you've got this nice socalled continuous graph。

😡，But the spot that's interesting is this x equal to 1。

 that's where I got some interesting behavior where I have to figure out what do I want to do。

So first of all， I'm going to do the limit from the left where I put my exponent minus1 here。

The function that I've graphed is the function 1 over 1 minus x。

 and you can see that there's a problem at x equal to1， a division by zero。

So what we can see from this graph is because it's going up and up and up and up and up and and up that what we can write down is that this limit is infinity。

 it's going to get arbitrarily large as our x values get arbitrarily close to one from the left。

And then I could also ask the same question， but now I could ask the limit。

 but this time from the right， so as I come from the right it goes down down down， down， down down。

 down down down， and I will say that this is going to be equal to minus infinity。Indeed。

 no matter how big of a negative number you choose， minus a million， minus a billion。

 minus a trillion， no matter how big of a number you choose。

You could just go closer and closer and closer on one until your function indeed got that gigantic negative number。

And then if I want to try to figure out what happens to the limit， the two sided limit。

 the one when I don't put any exponent and what I mean is from the left and from the right。

 both sides put together well。😡，On the one side， it's positive infinity。On the other side。

 it's minus infinity。 so they're different things。 it's not the case that when you come from the left and from the right that you get to the same results They're different things。

 and so what we write here is D and E4 does not exist and any time where the limit from the left and the limit from the right go to different values or in this case one goes to infinity and one goes to minus infinity。

 which I don't think of as a value， it's a concept。

 but nonetheless it's a different thing Then we're going to say that this limit does not exist So let's try to define this concept。

 the concept where the limit as S goes to a is equal to positive infinity saying by the way for minus infinity。

 you can adjust it I'm going to say that now my function gets arbitrarily large a million a billion a trillion however big you might choose we could accomplish that by getting really。

 really， really， really close but never equal really， really close to this value of a。

And there's also an analogous concept when you take the limit from the left or the limit from the right plus or minus infinity。

 there's a bunch of different versions， but the idea is always the same。

I had to make one little quick caveat， which is that when we talk about a limit being equal to infinity in a sense is a bit of an abusive notation。

 the limit still doesn't exist。 It's not like we're getting close to some number and the way。

 if I say the limit is equal to7， we're saying we're getting close to some number。

 So this limit doesn't technically exist， but among all the limits that don't exist that the infinite limits obey this particular property of getting arbitrarily large。

😡，So the convention is going to be that if I ask you for what this limit is。

 you could say that it's equal to infinity， but you maybe noted in the back of your mind that that doesn't mean the limit exists。

 it doesn't get close to any particular number。
