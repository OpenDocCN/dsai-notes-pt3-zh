# P20ï¼šL20- Definition of Derivative Example - f(x) = x + 1_(x+1) - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this exampleï¼Œ I'm going to compute the derivative of this functionï¼Œ x plus1 over x plus 1ã€‚

 but we're going to compute the derivative of that function by the definition of the derivativeã€‚

 the limit definition of the derivativeã€‚ Okayï¼Œ so let's remind ourselves what even is that So we're investigating the limitã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAs H goes to zero ofã€‚F of x plus Hã€‚Minus F of x all divided out by H Okayã€‚

 now I have a specific f of xï¼Œ and I want to feed that into hereã€‚ So in other wordsã€‚

 for our specific caseï¼Œ we're going to sayï¼Œ okayï¼Œ the limit is H goes to zeroã€‚

 we copy that down every time make sure you don't forget it I can go and have a big long quotã€‚

 I'm certainly going to have the division by Hï¼Œ but first I need to do Fã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOf x plus Hã€‚ Okayã€‚

 so this motion hereï¼Œ this f of x reads any input you take the input plus one over the input plus1ã€‚

 So for exampleï¼Œ F of Apple is Apple plus one over Apple plus1ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Now the specific input we are putting in is we're putting in x plus Hã€‚

 So I'm putting an x plus H thereï¼Œ which means there's an x plusation for this x and there's an x plusation for that Xã€‚

 So watch how it occursã€‚ What I'm going to get isï¼Œ first of allï¼Œ an x plus Hã€‚

 let's put a big bracket here because I think we're going to need it So x plus H and I'm going to put that in little round brackets then one over I got another x so it becomes an x plus H when I feed in x plus Hã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒPlus oneã€‚So that whole thing here is what my f of x plus H is and the two spots where x' isã€‚

 I now have an x plus Hã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen I need to subtract off F of xã€‚ Wellï¼Œ F of x is just thisã€‚

 so I'm subtracting off an x plus1 over x plus1ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkay so that's my limit definition applied to the specific function that I have in this problem so this is kind of long and messy let's try to clean it up as best we can I'm going to write the stuff that comes for free first let's go and put down the limit as H goes to zero because we always put that there and let's just not forget about itã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ nowï¼Œ looking at this gnarly expression on the topï¼Œ what can we doï¼Ÿ Wellã€‚

 one thing I notice is that there's an X here and there's another X thereã€‚

 So I can cancel them because they're subtractingã€‚ Soï¼Œ so that X and that X are going to go awayã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

I'm going to have this plus H here and I just nothing to do with thatã€‚ I just can't get rid of itã€‚

 so I'm going to come along here and I'm going to have an Hã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAll rightã€‚

Now what remains I have this expressionï¼Œ x plus h plus oneï¼Œ and I have this expression x plus oneã€‚

 and really it's the difference of these two fractionsã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

How do I do a difference of two fractions Will I do lowest common denominatorã€‚

 the lowest common denominator of x plus one and x plus h plus one is the product of those two thingsã€‚

 So I effectively am going to cross the ball apply the x plus one is going to come upã€‚

 the x plus h plus one is going to come up and I will get thisã€‚

 So it's going to be a big long fraction in the middle on the bottomã€‚Is the x plus H plus1ã€‚

Multiplied by x plus oneã€‚ So that's those two denominators that I have multiplied togetherã€‚

 The x plus one is going to come up hereã€‚ So I'm going to have an x plus oneã€‚

And then I'm going to subtract offã€‚V x plus h plus1 comes up over hereï¼Œ so x plus h plus1ã€‚All rightã€‚

 and then the whole thingï¼Œ I'll extend that line out is divided out by Hã€‚Wellã€‚

 as a cleaner a little bit cleanerï¼Œ I guess we've done some stuffã€‚

 but I still think it's kind of g narrowlyã€‚ I still want to do a bit more work to thisã€‚ Wellã€‚

 what can I doï¼Œ Okayï¼Œ let's investigate notice how I have a plus X and a minus X hereã€‚

 Those are gonna cancelã€‚ we can get rid of thoseã€‚I also have a plus one and a minus a plus oneã€‚

 so that's a minus one that cancels with thatã€‚And so I think all that I'm left with here is that there's a minus H up on the top is divided by that stuff that whole fraction is added to the H and then divided out by an H Okayã€‚

 now I'm going to do some even funier cancelingã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThere's an H hereï¼Œ rightï¼Ÿ

After I've gone and got rid of the x plus1 and the x+1ï¼Œ all that this numerator leaves is a minus Hã€‚

So there's an H here and there's an H hereï¼Œ which means everywhere on the topï¼Œ there is an Hã€‚

There's an H on the bottom so I can come alongï¼Œ I can cancel that H and that Hã€‚

 those are the two that are on my top this one comes with a minus1ï¼Œ we can't forget about itã€‚

 but there's an H there and there that H on the top cancels with the H that I have down on the bottomã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ let's see how it's going to work outã€‚ So this is gonna give us limit h going to0 of one plus Nowã€‚

 what remains over hereã€‚ I still have that minus H the H cancels divided by the top on the bottomã€‚

 at least behind a -1ã€‚ So -1 all divided by this stuff on the bottom I haven't done anything with itã€‚

 It's still thereã€‚ So x plus H plus1ã€‚Times x plus1ã€‚ And then when I look at that expressionï¼Œ there'sã€‚

 I think actually nothing else I have to doï¼Œ because the whole reason we didn't take h equal to 0 and plug it inã€‚

 say on the first step was that you'd have a0 on the top and a0 on the bottomã€‚

 I had to do more algebra before I could plug in H equal a0ã€‚ But now there's no division by hã€‚

 There's no0 on the bottomã€‚ So I can just take the one remaining hï¼Œ which is right hereã€‚

 And I can send it to 0ã€‚ And so what do I getï¼Œ I get1 plus minus1 divided by x plus1ã€‚

 And there's an x plus1 there when H goes to 0ï¼Œ there's an x plus1 thereã€‚ And so I square itã€‚

So my final answer is 1 plus negative1 over x plus 1 squaredã€‚

Just a couple little points about terminologyï¼Œ notice I have an unbroken chain of equal all the way through this note that I have a limited H goess to zero for every single one of these exceptã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe very final oneï¼Œ which is when I have evaluated the limit and actually said H to zeroã€‚
