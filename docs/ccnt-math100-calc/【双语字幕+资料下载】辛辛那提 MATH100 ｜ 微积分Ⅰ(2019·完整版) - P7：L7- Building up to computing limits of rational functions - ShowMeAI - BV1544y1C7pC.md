Let me do a really simple example next。 I want to do the limit of a constant as x goes to a value of a。

 So for example， I'm going to bring up a graph here。 This is the choice where my constantant was one。

 What is the limit of one， as x goes to a。 Well， doesn't matter where I am on here。

 if if I want to talk about this point right here， the limit as you get close to this point is one。

 limit as you get close to this point is one。 This point， Every point you could get close to。😡。

The height of it's always one。 So no matter what it is。

 it's the value of one or in the generic case when arbitrary C here。

 I'm going to say the limit is equal to C。 Okay， here's sort of the next most complicated function。

 Not a constant this time。 It's the variable X。😡。

So this is the graph of a straight line， it looks a little bit like this。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_11.png)

And notice if I was to do the limit as we get close to 0。5 here， 0。5 is just equal to well， 0。5。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_13.png)

AndIf I got close to the value of one up here， well that's going to have this height of one over here。

 if I go up to two， it's going to have this height of two。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_15.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_16.png)

So as we get close to any point A， because it's just this straight line that the height of it is going to be a as。

 and so the limit of the function x as the variable x goes to a is just going to be equal to a。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_18.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_19.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_20.png)

Okay， what about all this nonsense， We've got a whole polynomial inside of here。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_22.png)

What we get to do is we get to use these different rules。

 these limit laws to very quickly figure this out， and I'm going to go slowly this first time but in a moment。

 we're just going to answer this immediately。

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_24.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_25.png)

The idea is first， see where's the sum of three different things。

 and we saw that the limit of a sum was the sum of the limits。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_27.png)

So I can break that up as the sum of three different things， the sum of this first3 x cubed。

 the sum of the x and the sum of the minus1 is it's three different limits。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_29.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_30.png)

And we figured out what the limit of a constant was and the limit of x was we know both of those and I'm also going to try to break this one up notice we've got a scalar and weve got a product x cubed is like x times x times x so then when I advance this what we're going to have is first of all the triple product x times x times x is three different limits here the scalar gets built out of the front that was one of our rules and then for the limit of x and the limit of the minus1 I just plug in those values we just saw the a and the minus1。

😡。

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_33.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_34.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_35.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_36.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_37.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_38.png)

And now I've taken the x cubed down to a limit of x， we've just seen what that was， you plug in A。

 and so what we're going to get is 3a cubed plus the a minus1。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_40.png)

In other words， what we've done here is we just took this A that was there and we just't just plugged it in 3xq plus x minus1 became 3 aq plus a minus1 so poly wheels are really easy。

 there's nothing to do with the polynoome not to graph， you just plug the value in。



![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_42.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_43.png)

![](img/ddfe9c5139b904c492c76c2aaf5b61a1_44.png)

And indeed， it's true even slightly more general， it's true for something called rational function。

 so this is a rational function F of x， it's a polynomial on the top and a polynomial on the bottom。

And as long as you don't have the polynomial at this point。

 A being equal to a zero because you have some sort of division by zero thing。

 the limit is super easy， you just plug the value in whatever rational function you might have its limit is you just take that A that you're taking the limit to and you plug it in the same way this polynomial。

 we just plugged it in So for a ton of these values as long as you don't have a zero on the bottom as long as you don't have that problem spot that for these rational functions。

 limits are really easy， you just plug them in。😡。
