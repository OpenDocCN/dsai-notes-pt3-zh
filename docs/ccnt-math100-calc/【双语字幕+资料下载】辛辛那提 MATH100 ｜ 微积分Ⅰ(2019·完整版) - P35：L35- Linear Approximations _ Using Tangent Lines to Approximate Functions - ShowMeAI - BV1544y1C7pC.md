# P35ï¼šL35- Linear Approximations _ Using Tangent Lines to Approximate Functions - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

One of the reasons I really like the derivative and the derivative you'll remember gives us the slope of the tangent line is that tangent lines are nearby to a point a pretty good approximation a lot of the timeã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ let's look at here I've got the graph of sine effectsã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_1.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_4.png)

And what I've computed for you is the slope of its tangent line at x equal to zeroã€‚

 so I've got some particular line and I computed this by the derivative of sine of x and you can sort of intuitively see here that right near zero sine and its tangent line are like right on top of each other but but far away like over here s in the tangent line of nothing to do with each other it's quite dependent on the fact that the tangent line is a tangent line at one point and near that one point where I put my tangent line's like pretty good approximation far away and absolutely does not appear to beã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_8.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_9.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_10.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_11.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_12.png)

I'm gonna to do sort of imagine I'm gonna zoom in here a little bit so I've now narrowed my window now it's only minus1 to one here and you'll you'll notice that it looks good for longer Okay let me zoom in againã€‚

 minus1 to one is what I have right now and I'm gonna to go minus 0ã€‚

2 to 02 and I don't even know if you can resolve this on your screen the red in the green the sign and its tangent line are basically on top of each other as I zoom in on that windowã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_14.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_15.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_16.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_17.png)

So if I zoom in close enoughï¼Œ the tangent line and the original function here appear to be almost interable that it's a reallyã€‚

 really good approximationï¼Œ at least in the case of this functionï¼Œ side of xã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_19.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_20.png)

Let's do one more exampleã€‚Here I have the function square root of xã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_22.png)

And then I've taken the linear approximationï¼Œ this tangent line stands for line hereã€‚

 and I've done it at the value of x equal to 1ã€‚ so I've got this tangent line hereã€‚

 and again it looks like a pretty good approximation at the value of oneï¼Œ and we could zoom inã€‚

 zoom inï¼Œ zoom inï¼Œ zoom in until we had them basically exactly on top of each otherã€‚

 but sure it looks like a good approximationã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_24.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_25.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_26.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_27.png)

Now the reason why I chose one is I know the square root of one is the square root of one is just oneã€‚

 I can do that pretty easilyï¼Œ and indeed we could plug in the one here and we could get out the value of oneã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_29.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_30.png)

But you know what I don't know how to do in my headï¼Œ the square root of not one but 1ã€‚

5 I know it's 1ã€‚5 is my inputã€‚ it comes over to hereã€‚ there's some value of square root 1ã€‚

5 I could probably guess that it's in this regionï¼Œ but I don't know exactly what it isã€‚

 I don't know what this number isï¼Œ maybe it's got an infinite decimal expansionã€‚

 So how should we compute thisï¼Œ How does the computer even compute the square root of 1ã€‚5ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_32.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_33.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_34.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_35.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_36.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_37.png)

One thing that I could do as an approximation is if I look at this tangent line and remember this tangent line was a tangent line at oneã€‚

 it's not the tangent line at 1ã€‚5ï¼Œ 1ã€‚5 is a little ways awayï¼Œ so if I go over to 1ã€‚5ã€‚

 you can see that there's the green that's my square root of x and that there's the red that's my line and they're pretty close but they're not exactly the same but it's a good approximation right the height here on my tangent line of 1ã€‚

5 and the square root of 1ã€‚5 they're pretty closeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_39.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_40.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_41.png)

So I could do an investigation of thatï¼Œ I could ask at 1ã€‚

5 what is not square root of x but this lineï¼Œ this tangent line of 1 I could ask what is L of 1ã€‚

5 and yeah they're a little different but the error hereï¼Œ the differenceã€‚

 it's an extra height here it's really smallã€‚So our heuristic is thisã€‚

When I'm trying to estimate something like the square root of 1ã€‚5ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

What I'm going to do is I'm going to compute the tangent lineï¼Œ not at 1ã€‚5ã€‚

 but at a number I can actually computeï¼Œ I know how to do the square root of 1ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_43.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_44.png)

And then I'm going to try to figure out what that tangent line isã€‚

 I'm going to go along the line over to the 1ã€‚5ï¼Œ and that value is not going to be exactã€‚

 but it's going to be pretty goodã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_46.png)

Another way to think about this is to say that the square root of 1ã€‚

5 is whatever the the line is at 1ã€‚5ï¼Œ whatever my tangent line of 1ã€‚5 plus the small little errorã€‚

In this case where the tangent line is above the square root of xã€‚

 the small error is a small negative numberï¼Œ so it's that the green is a little bit less than the redã€‚

And another way I can say it is if my error truly is smallã€‚

 and I haven't justified outside of this graphical picture why it's smallï¼Œ but if it truly is smallã€‚

 then I'd be able to say that the square root of 1ã€‚

5 is approximately the same thing as the tangent line computed at the 0ã€‚1ã€‚

 but evaluated over here at 1ã€‚5ã€‚So let's try to figure out what is this tangentlaã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_48.png)

So that's our goalï¼Œ the square root of 1ã€‚5 is the tangent line at  oneï¼Œ but evaluated at 1ã€‚5ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_50.png)

And I'm going to remind you firstï¼Œ the general formula for a lineã€‚ So any line at allï¼Œ tangent lineã€‚

 secret lineï¼Œ any line you choose is going to haveã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_52.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_53.png)

Your y and your x is your variablesï¼Œ your y not and your x not as two starting pointsã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_55.png)

And then your M here is as the slope because this is so called the point slope formula for a line Sometimes people take this y n and the M times x n and they put it all over the rightã€‚

 and then it's y equals Mx plus B where B is the y interceptã€‚ You can do that formã€‚

 and that's the slope Y intercept formï¼Œ but I generally prefer the slope point form because I usually know two points in x n and a y nã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_57.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_58.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_59.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_60.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_61.png)

So let's try to do this for our scenarioï¼Œ we want to figure out the Mï¼Œ the M is the slopeã€‚

 and the slope is given by the derivativeã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_63.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_64.png)

So what's what I need to do derivative of square root of xï¼Œ easy enoughã€‚

 the only sort of weird trickery is to note that square root of x is really x to the power of12ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_66.png)

And I like it better in the form x to the1 half because then I can apply the power rule x to the one halfã€‚

 I apply the power rule hereï¼Œ the one half comes out the frontã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_68.png)

X to the one half minus-1 is x to the minus1 halfã€‚ That's why I have x to the minus1 halfã€‚

 and x to the minus1 halfã€‚ You don't have to do thisï¼Œ but it's nice to rewrite itã€‚

 The minus sign means it's x to the halfï¼Œ but on the bottomã€‚ and x to the half is square rootã€‚

 So1 over two square root of xã€‚ So there we go gotï¼Œ we've got what our slope is for all values of xã€‚

 And in particularï¼Œ What we're interested in is the pointã€‚ x equal to1ã€‚

 x equal to1 means square root of xã€‚ The y not here is also equal to1ã€‚ Pging one into hereã€‚

 I'm gonna a halfã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_70.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_71.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_72.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_73.png)

And thereforeï¼Œ taking all of this into my general formula for a lineã€‚

 what I get is going to be y minus1ï¼Œ that's the square root of oneã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_75.png)

Is equal to one halfã€‚ That's the slope here evaluated x equal to1 x minusã€‚ Wellã€‚

 x n is just equal to 1ã€‚ And so this is going to be my tangent lineã€‚

 And then if I actually want to write it as a line y equals somethingï¼Œ I'll take this -1ã€‚

 I'll move that over to the other sideã€‚ And what I get is L X is equal to the M x plus B formã€‚

 the slope intercept form1 f x plus a halfã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThisï¼Œ by the wayã€‚

 when I was doing my graphing beforehandï¼Œ I figured out this particular equation firstã€‚

 and that's how I was able to draw the tangent line going on top of the square root of xã€‚

 Now we've got L of x for all values of xã€‚ but remember where our goal isã€‚

 Our goal was the square root of 1ã€‚5 is aboutã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒL at 1ã€‚5ã€‚ so let's get rid of our calculationsã€‚

 I've got this L of x and what I want to do is figure out L of 1ã€‚5 they can plug in 1ã€‚5ã€‚

 so this is going to be three/ half divided by2 is three quartersï¼Œ three quarters and a half is 1ã€‚25ã€‚

 So that's my claim My claim is that square root of 1ã€‚5 is about not exactly but about 1ã€‚25ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_77.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_78.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_79.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_80.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_81.png)

Now I'm going to actually go on the calculator here and spit out exactly what the number is at least at two decimal places isã€‚

 I could compute that the square root of 1ã€‚5 according to my calculator is 1ã€‚22ï¼Œ not so badï¼Œ 1ã€‚251ã€‚

22ï¼Œ they're closeï¼Œ they're only a little bit awayã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_83.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_84.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_85.png)

Indeedï¼Œ if I go back to my originalï¼Œ I have this square root of 1ã€‚5ã€‚ that was the green hereã€‚

 which the calculator tells me is 1ã€‚22ã€‚ But by our approximationï¼Œ what we can see is that 1ã€‚25ã€‚

 that is what my tangent line at value of 1ã€‚5 is going to beã€‚ 1ã€‚25 minutes pretty close numberã€‚

 not so badã€‚ So in summaryï¼Œ the grand linear approximation formula isã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_87.png)

if I'm trying to approximate f of x where x is near some other value in the previous exampleã€‚

 we were looking at square root of 1ã€‚5 by comparing it to square root of 1ã€‚

 then what the formula tells me is I'm going to go and take the function value at a at this approximating point plus the slopeã€‚

 the f prime times the distance between them this x minus aã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_89.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_90.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_91.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_92.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_93.png)

Indeedï¼Œ this formula and the formula that we had for a lineã€‚

 they're really just the same different thingã€‚ I I sort of have to match them upã€‚

 Y is equal to f of Xï¼Œ that's my formulaã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_95.png)

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_96.png)

Then a is some particular point that I'm doing it in and F of a is just whatever the height isã€‚

 so that's the why notã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_98.png)

And then F prime of aï¼Œ that's our derivativeã€‚ So that's our slope M and x minus a x minus x not just different terminology for the same thingã€‚

 So I typically like to use this terminology when I'm talking about linear approximationsã€‚

 I got my functionã€‚ I've got my derivativeï¼Œ But I do remember the general formula for a lineã€‚

 Y minus y not is M X minus x notã€‚ Either wayï¼Œ It's the same ideaã€‚

 it's approximating by a line and this linear approximation formula is just the equation of the tangent lineã€‚

![](img/2694cb3fa34c976014edc2d4ab21e978_102.png)

At the point Aï¼Œ but evaluatedï¼Œ this formula is evaluated at the point Xã€‚
