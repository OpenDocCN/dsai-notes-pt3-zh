# P54ï¼šL54- Adjusting the Constant in Integration by Substitution - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

All rightï¼Œ let's do one more exampleã€‚

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_1.png)

What we have here is now the integral of e to the 2 x on the top all divided by1 plus e to the 2 x on the bottom so they figure out what's my f here and what's my U and one of the things that I can sort of note right off the top is thatã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

When I take the derivative of1 plus e to the 2 xï¼Œ Im going to get twice e to the 2 xã€‚

 I mean there's this factor of 2 there that's a bit confusingã€‚

 but it sort of looks like the top here is related off by a factor of  twoã€‚

 but it's related to the derivative of the bottomã€‚

So let me experiment with setting you to be that denominatorã€‚



![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_9.png)

Okayï¼Œ so how does that workï¼Œ U is the one plus e to the 2 xï¼Œ It's derivative usï¼Œ as we saidã€‚

 was the twice E to the 2 x Dxã€‚

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_11.png)

Wellï¼Œ if that's my uï¼Œ what's my fï¼Œ this looks like the function one divided by u times Dã€‚

 but we're off by this factor of two all right so that's the U and the Dã€‚

 but what is going to be in that case the Fï¼Ÿ

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_15.png)

Now if I think about this expressionï¼Œ the place where u occurs is on the denominator so I think my F looks like1 divided out by u and if they set my f to be one over U that means that the capital Fã€‚

 the antideriv of the lowercase Fï¼Œ its just going to be the natural logarithm of the absolute value of U now why is this the caseã€‚

 well if we take the derivative of the natural logarithm of the absolute value of u we're going to get one divided by u so indeedã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_18.png)

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_19.png)

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_20.png)

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_21.png)

![](img/62b4a96591a1cd8eb1a8679be85bdf5d_22.png)

Capital F is an anti derivative of the lowercase of Fã€‚Okayï¼Œ so now if I take what my expression isã€‚

 notice how I'm going to relate it so we have this integral want to computeã€‚

 but what I've done here is I've divided out by a two and I've multiplied by a two and I can multiply and divide by a two thats just multiply by one that't doesn't do anythingã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒBut the reason why I do it is because now when I've got this two on the topã€‚

 even though it's canceled down hereï¼Œ 2 e to the 2 x dxï¼Œ2 e to the 2 x dxã€‚

 that is just D that is what I have done is managed to write this as one half the integral of one over U D so we get the one half that just comes along for the rightã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe integral of one over U becomes a natural logarithm and I evaluated it at you where you is this one plus e to the 2 x and finally I add in the plus Cã€‚

 so that is going to be my general antid to this funky expressionã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And it's worth noting that integration in general is actually quite a bit harder than differentiationã€‚

 Most of these functions that you can combine with quotients and products and compositions and exponents of the elementary functions we've been talking about EDV X and sine and polynomialsã€‚

 we can just apply a rules and take the derivatives of all of themã€‚

 but the other way around is not quite so simpleï¼Œ some ingrs when you take the integral of some functionsã€‚

 it's able to be done because it can be manipulated to look into one of these nice forms like we have here with the substitution ruleã€‚

 but that is in generalï¼Œ not the case and there's all sorts of integrals where we don't have a nice rule like this to be able to applyã€‚
