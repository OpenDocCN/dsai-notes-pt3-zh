# P16ï¼šL16-Area of Surfaces of Revolution _ Derivation & Example - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Let's begin with a curve in the two dimensional planeï¼Œ I've got an x axisï¼Œ and I've got a y axisã€‚

 but I can think of this curve three dimensionallyã€‚

If I look at this two dimensional plane and I sort of rotate my perspectiveã€‚

 Change my camera angle a little bitã€‚ I can think of that plane as embedded in three dimensionsã€‚

 and X and y as I had beforeï¼Œ but now also a Z axisã€‚ And when I have that scenarioã€‚

 I can imagine things like rotating in three dimensionsã€‚ So let me take this curveã€‚

 And then we rotate it around the X axisã€‚ And what that gets is something that looks a little bit like thisã€‚

 It gives me that is a surface areaã€‚ surface area of revolutionã€‚

 So our goal in this video is to come up with a formula for how to compute surface areas of revolutions for examples like this oneã€‚

 By the wayï¼Œ back in calculus 1ï¼Œ we talked about regions that are formed by revolutionã€‚

 But in calculus 1ï¼Œ we talked about the volume inside of this regionã€‚

 But what I'm doing here is just asking the surface area of the outer shellã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNowã€‚

 how could we actually compute something like thisã€‚ We're in calculusã€‚

 which means that we're going to use the same idea that we did for arc lane that we've done for many other topics in calculusã€‚

 which is we take this regionï¼Œ which is large and complicatedã€‚

 And we break it up into a list of smaller regions that we can understandã€‚

 We figure out how that's going to work and we take a limit as the number of regions goes to infinityã€‚

 So in this caseï¼Œ what I'm going to focus on is not the entire thingï¼Œ but just one little ribbonã€‚

 If I just take a small portion of the curve and rotate just that small portion of the curveã€‚

 I get a ribbon like thisã€‚ It has a small surface areaã€‚ And the question isã€‚

 what is that small surface areaã€‚ And if I can answer thatã€‚

 I can figure out the surface area just of the ribbon hereã€‚

 then I add a whole bunch of those ribbons up all in a row until I get my total surface areaã€‚

 that's going to be my approximationã€‚ Nowï¼Œ the first thing I think about when I think about how to do the surface area for this little ribbonã€‚

 is that it's pretty close to a circleã€‚There is indeed some width to itã€‚

 But if I ignored that for a momentï¼Œ which just looked like a circleã€‚

 and I know at least what the circumference of a circle isã€‚ It's two pi times the radiusã€‚

 So in this scenario here where the radius goes from the X axis up to my functionã€‚

 that's going to tell me is that the radius is just the value of the functionã€‚

 So I'm going to put a little radius in hereï¼Œ I'm going to call this the radius is F of some point X starã€‚

 What I mean by X star hereã€‚ star means I don't know exactly what the point isã€‚

 but I'm imagining taking my X from a to B and chopping it up into n different componentsã€‚

 I can have an I little regionã€‚ and X star is just some pointã€‚ I don't know exactly what it isã€‚

 but some point in the I little regionã€‚ Now you might point out that because this ribbon is sort of twisted up a little bitã€‚

 it makes it appear that say the left hand side as a smaller radius and the right hand sideã€‚

 that's trueã€‚ But if we think about the limit as the number of subdivisionã€‚

Goes to infinity that indeedï¼Œ the width is going to be getting smaller and smaller and the difference between these is going to get smaller and smallerã€‚

 So I'm not going worry about thatã€‚ I'm just going to choose some point in the middle and F of X star that is is going to be the radiusã€‚

 when the radiusï¼Œ the circumference is just going to be then two pi times that radiusã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the next thing I have to deal withã€‚ and this is the tricky part is dealing with the widthã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Because if I look here at the width hereï¼Œ it's actually not parallel to the x axisã€‚

 This function is not completely flatã€‚ The function is curved up a little bitã€‚ And so as a resultã€‚

 you have a ribbon that's a little bit twistã€‚ So this width is more than just deelta Xã€‚

 So we're going to have to deal with thatï¼Œ we're going to open up this problem of figuring out the width in a momentã€‚

 But if we had the widthï¼Œ I could approximate this is just the surface area is the circumferenceã€‚

 this two pi times f of X I star times the widthã€‚ So what is that widthã€‚

 let me look at this problem two dimensionally to make the graph a little bit easierã€‚

 I have some curveã€‚ So here's my curve x squared againã€‚

 What I am going to do is the same basic process that we did when we talked about arc lengthã€‚

 I'm going to put a bunch of points downï¼Œ and I'm going to have a bunch of straight lines between all those pointsã€‚

 In this caseï¼Œ I've divided up into five different regionsã€‚

 And then when we were deriving the arc length formulaã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

We talked about how Dlta x was going to be the change in the horizontal and delta y sub I was going to be the change in the vertical and delta y sub I depended on what I was it was going to changeã€‚

Then you could use Pythagoras to figure out the length of that secant lineã€‚

 and the length of that secret line was going to be square root of deelta x squared plus deta Y I squaredã€‚

And then the final thingï¼Œ the most important part of the arc length video that we did was we applied the mean value theorem to replace this delta Y I with instead the derivative of the function at some point X star Delta Xã€‚

 Now I'm not going repeat why we did thatï¼Œ that's in the arc length videoã€‚

 you can go and take a look at thatã€‚ Howeverï¼Œ now that we know what this little length isã€‚

 that is the exactly the width in the previous pictureã€‚

 So if I go back to my three dimensional case hereï¼Œ I'm trying to figure out well what is the widthã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ the width in my approximation is precisely that length of that little straight lineã€‚

 So when place of the widthï¼Œ I'm going to come along here and put in that square root of all of that nonsenseã€‚

Wellï¼Œ this is my surface areaï¼Œ at least my approximated surface area for this ribbonã€‚

 Remember what my goal isã€‚ My goal is not just this ribbonã€‚ It's the entire thingã€‚

 So what do I have to doï¼Œ I have to add them upã€‚ So I'm going to take this region hereã€‚

 this surface areaï¼Œ which is just for the one ribbonã€‚

 And I'm going to take this sum of it from one up to endã€‚

 and that's going to add all the different ribbons all the way along and construct the entire surface areaã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒFin couple things to doã€‚ Firstï¼Œ I've got to delta X in multiple placesã€‚

 I'm going to factor that outã€‚ that cleans it up a little bitã€‚

 and then I'll do the key trick of calculusï¼Œ which is to say I take a limit of this thing as n goes to infinityã€‚

 And when I do that When I take the limit as n goes to infinityã€‚

 I first change from an approximation to an equal sign and I change the summation to an integralã€‚

 So what happensï¼Œ we get that the surface areaï¼Œ the integral from a up to Bã€‚

 those are my n points in Xã€‚The two pi F of the continuous variable X nowã€‚

 And then I put in my square root of this one plus the derivative squaredã€‚ All of that times D Xã€‚

 That is my surface area of revolution formulaã€‚ All rightï¼Œ let's do an example of thisã€‚

 So here's my formulaã€‚ And I want to consider the exampleã€‚ X cubed from 0 up to  oneã€‚ That isã€‚

 I'm trying to find the surface areaã€‚ Here's the picture one more time with X cubed put in thereã€‚

 I'm trying to figure out that whole surface areaã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo in the arc lake formulaã€‚

 my function is going to be the x cubedï¼Œ and my endpointsã€‚

 the A and the B are going to be the 0 and the 1ã€‚ So I can plug that into the formulaã€‚

 What I get is the integral from 0 to1 of two pi the functionï¼Œ two pi times x cubedã€‚

And then the derivative of x cubed is3 x squaredã€‚ So I put that in for f primeã€‚

 So I get a square root of1 plus3 x squared all squared dxã€‚

 And now this is just an integral and integral that we can try to compute so how do we do that Well I think I would make u to be the inside of my square root so I can plug that in hereã€‚

 U is the one plus3 squared is9 x to the fourth D is therefore 36 x cubedã€‚

 I can make the transformation of the limits of integration that when I plug in x equal to 0ã€‚

 I'm going to get1 when I plug in x equal to 1ï¼Œ I'm going to get 10 for my U then entirely right in this in terms of Uã€‚

 I get the integral from1 up to 10 of2 pi over 36 square root u I integrate thatã€‚

 I plug in the values and I get a final answerã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAllrightã€‚

 so we have managed to repeat what we did for arc lengthã€‚

 the process of breaking it up into a bunch of different regions and trying to figure out exactly what the length of the straight lines were everything we did for arc lengthã€‚

 We'd have just done it again now for surface area of revolution where effectively took the arc length that we rotated all of those little pieces around multiplying by the two pi F of X as we did soã€‚

 And then finallyï¼Œ we've seen that this works out pretty simply in an actual explicit exampleã€‚
