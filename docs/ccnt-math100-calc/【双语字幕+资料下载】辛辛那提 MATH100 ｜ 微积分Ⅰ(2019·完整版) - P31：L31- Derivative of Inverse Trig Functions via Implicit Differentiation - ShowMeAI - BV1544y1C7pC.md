# P31ï¼šL31- Derivative of Inverse Trig Functions via Implicit Differentiation - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

So we're back with our old friend Arc tangentï¼Œ which we had seen before that we have the graph of 10 and that arc10 is what happens when we alternate the x and the yã€‚

 or when we invert over the lineï¼Œ y equals xï¼Œ at least for this restricted domain between minus pi over 2 and plus pi over 2ã€‚

So then the question isï¼Œ if I've got Arc10 and are any of the other a trignometric functionsã€‚

 what are their derivativesï¼Œ and what we can do is we can use implicit differentiation to answer these questionsã€‚

So I want to remind you that the definition of saying that Y was arc tangent of x what that meant was I could invert it the other way around is that I could come and take a tan of y and get a tan of my arc tangent and because they were an inverse functions the sort of tan and arc tangã€‚

 they undo each other and you just get back with whatever the inside wasã€‚

 so y is arc tangent of x is the same thing as that tangent of y is just equal to xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_10.png)

So why don't I come along and take the derivative with respect to x of both sidesã€‚

 that is I can take the derivative respect to x of tangent of y and the derivative respect to x just of xã€‚

 nor ignoring now this middle termã€‚

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_13.png)

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_14.png)

Notice that we're going to be doing implicit differentiationï¼Œ Y here is some function of xã€‚

 and so I'm going to try to take this derivative implicitlyã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_16.png)

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_17.png)

This is a compositionï¼Œ indeed tangent of y if y is a function of xã€‚

 this is an outside function 10 and an inside functionï¼Œ y of xã€‚

 so I'm going to use the chain rule and what I get from that is that the derivative of 10 is C can't squaredã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_20.png)

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_21.png)

And then I'm going to multiply by the derivative of the inside function with my chain ruleã€‚

 and the derivative of the inside function is y so d Y dxã€‚



![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_23.png)

And on the right hand sideï¼Œ the derivative respect to x of x is just oneï¼Œ shockingã€‚



![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_25.png)

So we've got some relationship next upï¼Œ I want to go when I want to isolate the dy dxã€‚

 so I'm going to divide out here and say that dy dx is1 over secantant squared of yã€‚

 Now this answer that I have down hereï¼Œ the derivative is one over secant squared of y is okay But if I think about what I really want when I'm taking the derivative of an explicit function I say this is some function of x and its derivative should be some other function of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_27.png)

What I've gotten in is taken drews to x and I've got some function of y is one over sec again squared of yã€‚

 but I really want to have this back as being with respect to X and I'm going to show you some tricks of a nice way to solve this in terms of X so let me keep that formula and I'm going remind you about a couple of different trigoometric identitiesã€‚

 the Pythagorean identities and they look like thisã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

The main one I would memorize is this top one sine squared plus co squared is equal to oneã€‚

 The reason why I say that's the important one to memorize is that the other twoã€‚

 I can get those from sine squared plus co squared equals oneã€‚ Indeedï¼Œ take this formulaã€‚

 divide them both by cosine squaredã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_33.png)

Sine squared divided by co squared is10 squaredã€‚ Co squared divided by co squared is1ã€‚

 and one divided by co squared is c1 squaredã€‚ So indeedï¼Œ this is just dividediding out by co squaredã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒLikewiseï¼Œ for this bottom1ï¼Œ I divide the sine squared plus co squared equal to 1 by sine squaredã€‚

 sine squared over sine squared is1ï¼Œ co squared over sine squared is cotangent and one divided by sine squared is cosK squaredã€‚

So we need to know all three of these Pythagorean identitiesã€‚

 but I typically just memorize the first one and deduce the other twoã€‚

 however you like to do it is fine by meã€‚Nonethelessï¼Œ for the purposes of what we're doing hereã€‚

 one over CN squaredï¼Œ there's a secN squaredï¼Œ it looks like it's 10 squared plus 1ã€‚

 so I'm going to replace one over CN squared by one over 10 squared plus1ã€‚



![](img/273c8af4b1dc3d53775567dd0b4b5df5_35.png)

The reason why I did thisï¼Œ The reason why I wanted it to be back in terms of tangent is that we know about the relationship between X and tangent of yã€‚

 indeedï¼Œ our defining property was y was arc tangent of x which is the same thing as x is tangent of Yã€‚

 So in other wordsï¼Œ this tangent of y that I have is just xã€‚

 so I can say that this is1 over x squared plus1ã€‚ and indeed this is the final answerã€‚

 this is the derivative of arc tangentï¼Œ it is a function of x1 over x squared plus1 and then very final step reminding ourselves that the y hereã€‚

 what was y Y was arc tangent of x I get my final formulaã€‚

 which is the derivative of a tangent of x1 over x squared plus1 some function of xã€‚

 The process that we've used to figure out the derivative of arc tangentã€‚

 you can take the same basic process and figure out the derivatives of all the different ones cosine or sine or cotangentã€‚

 whatever you likeã€‚
