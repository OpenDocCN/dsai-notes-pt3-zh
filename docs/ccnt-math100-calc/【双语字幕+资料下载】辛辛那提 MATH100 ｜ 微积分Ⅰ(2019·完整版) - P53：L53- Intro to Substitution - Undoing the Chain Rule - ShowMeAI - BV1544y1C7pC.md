# P53ï¼šL53- Intro to Substitution - Undoing the Chain Rule - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

When we first defined derivativesï¼Œ one of our initial tasks was to go through and prove as many differentiation rules as we couldã€‚

 for exampleï¼Œ we would prove what the derivative of a power wasã€‚

 we'd prove what the derivative of the sum of two things was and so onã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_3.png)

Then when it came time to do integrationï¼Œ we've already seen how to do the integralï¼Œ for instanceã€‚

 of x to the an powerï¼Œ we've seen how rules like that the derivativeruto of a sum is the sum of the derivatives carry over into the integration context and indeed that the integral of a sum is the sum of the different integralsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_7.png)

Now one rule from differentiation that we haven't dealt with yet in the integration context is the chain ruleã€‚

 so here I have I've put it up for youï¼Œ it's the derivative of like a compositionã€‚

 an outside function big Fï¼Œ a little function G was the derivative of the outside at the inside finally multiplied by the derivative of the insideã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_9.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_10.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_11.png)

And no by the wayï¼Œ as I set up this formula in its standard form I'm using a capital F on the outside and a little G here and indeed whenever we're doing integrationã€‚

 we will typically adopt that the derivative of big F is little F or in other wordsã€‚

 big F is the antider of little F so let me take that little notation and fire that into the formula here so in other words I'm going to say DDx of big F of G of x is little F G of x times G prime of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_13.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_14.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_15.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_16.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_17.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_18.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_19.png)

Now this is just an equation in terms of the variable of xã€‚

 we have this function of x on the left and this other function of x on the rightã€‚

 so I can take the integral of both sides with respect to xã€‚

 so let me wrap this integral signs I'm saying the integral with respect to x that's what the dx means integral respect to x of the derivative respect to x of big f of g of x and that's going to be equal to the integral also with respect to x of f of g of x times g prime of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_21.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_22.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_23.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_24.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_25.png)

Now the left hand sideï¼Œ I know how to deal with this because when I'm asking for the indefinite integral of somethingã€‚

 I want to be able to find some antid and I know that the general form here is that antid plus an arbitrary constantant C So the question is what is an antideriv to this inside function well an antid to the derivative of something is just that something So in the words this left hand side here is just going to be F of G of x plus C and I copy and paste the right hand side where this f of G of x is going to be an antid of the derivative of f of G of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_27.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_28.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_29.png)

So what I have an effect done is I've derived this particular equationã€‚

 which is an way of computing out what the integral of this funky formã€‚

 somewhat bizarre form F of G times G primeï¼Œ but if we have an integral of that formã€‚

 we can figure out what its antider is as long as we know what the anti derivative of just the F is going to beã€‚

 and indeed this is going to substantially widen for usã€‚

 the class of functions that we're able to integrateã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_31.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_32.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_33.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_34.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_35.png)

This equation that we have is typically called the substitution ruleã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_37.png)

And indeedï¼Œ wellï¼Œ ass perfectly fine what it as it isã€‚

 we can often simplify at least notationally and we call it something called U substitution and the idea for U substitution is just to give a fancy name hereã€‚

 So what I'm going to do is this G of Xï¼Œ which is a little largeã€‚

 I'm going to simplify and just call it Uã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_39.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_40.png)

Then if I take this left hand side and I try to make it equal to somethingã€‚

 I'm saying so the G of x was u so I just say it's f of u plus C now big F of u of plus Eã€‚

 I can write that as an integral because big F represents an antider to little Fã€‚

 so I can take this F of u plus C and I can write it as the integral of f of u to Uã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_42.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_43.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_44.png)

Notï¼Œ by the way that we've often written things the integral of F of Xï¼Œ Dxã€‚

 but doesn't matter what we call a variableï¼Œ it can be F of UDUï¼Œ F of TDTï¼Œ F of Gï¼Œ DGã€‚

 it really doesn't matter we conventionally use for U subitution F of U DUã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_46.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_47.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_48.png)

So what we've really compared here is we've taken this integral of F of G times g prime dxã€‚

 and we've written it just as by this substitution with u equals G of x as F of u to U so then finally if I compare these two expressions that we have hereã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_50.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_51.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_52.png)

The F of G of xï¼Œ when I plug into you is just F of Uï¼Œ which is what I have down hereã€‚

 And so what remains the G prime of X Dxï¼Œ I can identify that with just this Dã€‚ So other wordsã€‚

 I'm saying that the D is going to be this G prime of X Dxã€‚

 I'm going finally summarize it as saying the substitution rule is going to allow us to take integrals of this funky typeã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_54.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_55.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_56.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_57.png)

By letting u equals the G of xï¼Œ we can rewrite this as the integral of f of U Dã€‚

 and we get its answerï¼Œ it's just going to be F of U plus Cã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_59.png)

let's see how it works out in a specific exampleï¼Œ here I have the integral of 2x times sine of x squared dxã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_61.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_62.png)

Nowï¼Œ my first task is to take this integral and try to write it in this nice formatã€‚

 I want to identify what should be my Fï¼Œ what should be my U and what should be my DUã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_64.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_65.png)

So first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to sort try to color code a little bitã€‚

 you notice how there's a sign of x squaredï¼Œ so you think there's an outer function sign and an inner function x squaredã€‚

 we have that compositionã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_67.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_68.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_69.png)

And then the derivative of x squared is 2xï¼Œ and notice that I have combined this 2x dxã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_71.png)

So I'm going to set that my U is equal to x squaredã€‚

 and I'm going to set my du is equal to the 2x dxã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_73.png)

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_74.png)

My function is going to be this sine of u and it's anti derivativeã€‚

 I know the anti derivative to sine is going to be minus cosine of Uã€‚

So I' sort of gone off on the side here and I've collected all the relevant pieces of informationã€‚

 so it now looks like something of this formã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_76.png)

And so what I'm going to do is now plug in to the answerï¼Œ it's the anti derivative of F of Uã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/7d2e0462a4563d1cb344c9d952a0f97b_78.png)

Wellï¼Œ the anti derivative is right hereï¼Œ it's the minus cos of u u is x squaredã€‚

 and so what we're going to finally get is that this is equal to minus cos of x squared and then finally plus the all important Cã€‚
