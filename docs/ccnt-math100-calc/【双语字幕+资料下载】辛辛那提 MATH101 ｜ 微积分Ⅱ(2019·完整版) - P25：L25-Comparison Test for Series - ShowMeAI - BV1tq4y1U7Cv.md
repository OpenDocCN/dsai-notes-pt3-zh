# P25ï¼šL25-Comparison Test for Series - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Suppose that I have the graph of two different seriesã€‚ There's an A Nï¼Œ and there's a B Nã€‚

 and the B N is always bigger than the A N and both of them are positiveã€‚

 What we're going to study in this video is a comparison testã€‚

 where you compare the convergence or divergence of the A N to the convergence or the divergence of the B Nã€‚

 Soï¼Œ for instanceï¼Œ imagine that the seriesï¼Œ the sum of the A Ns was a divergent seriesã€‚

 The smaller of those twoã€‚ And you added them upï¼Œ went off to infinityã€‚ Wellï¼Œ then the Bnsã€‚

 which are something that are bigger than the A Nsã€‚ They're bigger than a divergent seriesã€‚

 they must be divergent as wellï¼Œ which is to say that if the seriesã€‚

 the sum of the AN's divergence than so too does the B Nsã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then the other way around is that if the bigger seriesï¼Œ if the B Nï¼Œ if that convergesã€‚

 then the smaller seriesï¼Œ the A N are gonna to converge as wellã€‚ This is the comparison testã€‚

 Let's see how this applies in a specific example like this oneã€‚

 This is a pretty messy series We've got an n -1 on the topã€‚

 A 2 n cubed plus an n squared on the bottomã€‚ It's not one that I can do by the other methodsã€‚

 It's not a geometric series is not a P seriesï¼Œ I can go and try to do an integral test on itã€‚

 but that looks like a messy integralã€‚ So what can we doã€‚ Wellï¼Œ let me consider the A Ns hereã€‚

 This expressionã€‚ And let's try to do a comparison with somethings a little bit nicerã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 if I look at the numeratorã€‚ If I look at the n -1 hereï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ the numeratorã€‚

 because I subtract one is strictly greater than if I have the same denominatorã€‚

 but only n on top as if this is less than n over2 n cubed plus n squaredã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then if I focus my efforts now on the denominatorï¼Œ Wellï¼Œ in the denominatorã€‚

 I have this plus n squared n squared is something positiveã€‚

 So adding something positive in the denominator makes the entire thing smallerã€‚

 So it's also going to be smallerã€‚ If I just take away that n squared and just write it as n over to n cubedã€‚

 This is a strict inequalityã€‚ And then n over n cubedã€‚

 I can cancel out one copy of n and I'm just left with1 over to N squaredã€‚

 So I have this inequality that's taken this messy thingï¼Œ the A N that I didn't likeã€‚

 So I have this inequality that's taken this messy thingã€‚

 the A that I didn't like and related it to a Bnï¼Œ which is much simplerã€‚ In factã€‚

 I know whether this B N converges or divergesã€‚ it is a P seriesã€‚ back when we did the integral testã€‚

 but we compare it to the P integralï¼Œ the improper integral1 up to infinity of1 over x squaredã€‚

 that converge because the P of 2 is greater than1ã€‚ So indeedï¼Œ we knowã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

sum of this one over two n squaredï¼Œ the Bns that converges by the P testã€‚

 And if this bigger thing convergesï¼Œ then the smaller onesã€‚

 the sum of the ANs has to converge as wellã€‚ So what do we getã€‚

 we get that this summation indeed converges to Notice by the way that because I demanded that the ANs and the Bns were both positive that meant that you didn't have some scenario where the bigger one convergedã€‚

 but the smaller one went down to minus infinity going down to0 was the smallest it could beã€‚

 So this comparison test is really useful for coning series that are messy and complicated and we don't want to deal with into much simpler onesã€‚

 ones that hopefully we already know the answer to whether it converges or whether it divergesã€‚

 Notice by the way that it doesn't converge to the same thing just because the one converges in the other convergesã€‚

 it doesn't mean they converge to the same valueã€‚ the comparison test is useless for thatã€‚

 it only answers the question of convergence or divergenceã€‚Finallyã€‚

 I want to point out that we've seen a comparison test beforeã€‚

 If this comparison test apply to series where I had a bigger Bn and a smaller Aã€‚

 We've also seen one for improper integralsã€‚ We had a picture somewhat like thisã€‚

 where you had a bigger function and a smaller function and you'd say something like thisã€‚

 if the larger function converges in the integral fromï¼Œ say one up to infinityã€‚

 then the smaller one converges as wellã€‚ And if the smaller one diverges the bigger one diverges as wellã€‚

 final thing I want to talk about is don't get yourself trickpedã€‚

 If you cannot find an inequality that works the right wayï¼Œ Where it the bigger one convergingã€‚

 telling you the smaller one converging or the smaller one divergingã€‚

 telling you the bigger one divergingï¼Œ if it's not one of those two scenariosã€‚

 you can apply the comparison testã€‚ Soï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ if the larger one divergesã€‚

 it doesn't tell you anything about what the smaller one doesã€‚

 because the smaller one could converge and something bigger than it could diverge that entirely possibleã€‚

 And likewiseï¼ŒðŸ˜Šï¼ŒASmal one convergesï¼Œ wellï¼Œ that doesn't tell you anything at all about the bigger one because the bigger one could still diverge despite the smaller one convergingã€‚
