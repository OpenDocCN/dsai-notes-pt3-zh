Consider the functions F and G and the property of these functions is that F is greater than G and that both of them are positive。

Now， in the first video on improper intervals， we studied things like the integral from to up to infinity of functions like this。

 So for example， we might be interested in the area under the curve from the value of two all the way to infinity and what we saw is that these kind of improper intervals。

 it may converge to a finite value that this area converges to a finite number or it may be that it diverges Now what I want to do in this video is a comparison test a way to talk about improper integrals involving F and compare them to integrals involving G and try to get some sort of convergence or divergence information out of it。

So， for example， suppose it was the case that this integral。

 this integral from 2 to infinity of F of x did converge， it converge to a finite value L。 Well。

 what then can we say about the same kind of integral， But now for the G， I want to ask。

 what is the integral from 2 up to infinity of G of x Dx， Does it converge， does it diverge。

 what can we say， Maybe we can't say anything。😡，Well。

 if I look at this picture and I try to intuitively think about what's happening。

 we know that this area is positive for both of them。

 indeed the F is bigger than G and G is bigger than zero。😡。

But the G here is sort of sandwich between。 It has to be positive。

 but it has to be some number that's smaller than the integral of the F。

 And we know that that converges by our assumption。

 So it seems reasonable to conclude that the integral from2 to infinity of G of x converges as well。

 I don't know what it converges to。 It might be a very different value where there's no guarantee it's the same L。

 But I think it does converge。 And the fact that G is positive here is important。

 it means it can't have a scenario where it goes above and beneath the x is over and over and over again and has sort of an oscillatory behavior and diverges for that reason。

 because it's positive， but beneath the F， I think indeed， it's going to converge。 Now。

 let's take this a little bit more precisely。 I'll take the F and the G。 And I'll focus on those。

 And I have this order F is greater than G， which is greater than 0。

Now if I take any definite integral， we know the result， we had this theorem back in calculus 1。

 so a definite integral where A and B are numbers says that the definite integral of F of x is greater than the definite integral of the same domain of G of x。

 then it's definitely going to be positive。So now I can use this to talk about convergeences。

 If I imagine what happens for the improper integral where the B here is replaced with infinity。

 the way improper integrals are defined is that it's a limiting concept。

 you take a limit as the B values go off towards infinity。 But in that case。

 because it's always going to be greater than it， it says that if the bigger one converges if the F converges。

 then so2 does the smaller one， So2 does the G。 And so we have this comparison at test conversely we can go the other way around。

 So if the smaller one diverges to infinity， then the bigger one must diveerge as well。

 It is to say if the G of x is going to diverge， then the F of x。

 the integral from a up to infinity of the F of x， that must diveerge as well。 Now。

 notice carefully that this result is about convergence versus divergence。

 but it doesn't tell me what it converges2。 if the bigger one converges to L， it doesn't。

You what the small one converges to something smaller than L and bigger than 0 for sure。

 but the exact value we don't know。 Now， if we're going to apply the comparison test。

 we have to have something to compare functions to and there is one class of intervals that are well known that we have an answer and that we sort of saw a little bit in the previous video。

 This is the class of intervals one over x to the P as you take the integral from say1 up to infinity。

What we saw previously is that if I had something like2 for the value of P。

 So one over x squared that that did converge， but that if I had p equal to1。

 then the antid derivative of this was logarithm and that was going to diverge generally。

 we're gonna to have the result that this so called P integral。

 It converges for all p values that are strictly greater than1。

 And it diverges for all p values that are between 0 and1。

 We saw some special cases that this in the previous video。

 but I'd actually encourage you to go and work this out and verify that that claim is true。

 But now that I have this now that I have this sort of p integral。

 it allows me to do a lot of simplification on other integrals that are related but a bit more complicated。

 For example， consider this one。 This is the integral from one up to infinity of x minus-2 divided by x cubed plus1。

😊，Now， what I want to do is take this integra， which is messy。

 And I'm just just going to focus just on the integra for a moment。

 And I am going to do a comparison by writing inequalities to a P integral。

 Look at the numerator first， X -2。X minus2 because I am subtracting to is a smaller number than just x。

So why don't I take this x -2， and I will relate it to x， and I get to put an inality。

 This is smaller than x over x cubed plus1。 Okay， now let me look at the plus1。 Well。

 the plus1 now is on the bottom。 So adding one makes the denominator bigger。

 which makes the whole thing smaller。😡，So if I don't add this one。

 I'm going to get something that's actually gonna be bigger。

 So I can replace this with x divided by x cubed。 I have a string of inequalities。 And then。

 of course， x over x cube is just one over x squared。 So this is a P integral grand。

 with the value P equal to2。 This is exactly what we saw in the previous video。

 and we know that this integral is gonna converge。 So what we can finally conclude is that because the integral from one up to infinity 1 over x squared converges that we know that's a p integral。

 that deduces that the integral from1 up to infinity of this new complicated thing this x minus2 over x cube plus1。

 that thing must also converge So there's a little bit of a tradeoff at play here。

 We gain something and we lose something。 The thing what we gain is we're allowed to make a lot of simplifications。

 This x minus2 over xq plus1。 That's a hard integral。 I tried for a little bit。

 I didn't get an obvious answer， maybe you could go a tri。 The truth of the matter is that。😊。

Classes of integrals actually do not have some method that you're able to integrate it。

 at least not in terms of elementary functions like polynomials and signs and co-sines。

 There's all sorts of ones that you just cannot do。 So often we can never find the exact value。

 at least not by analytically finding an antideriv。

 So the advantage here is that we're able to simplify this complicated thing we don't know into something that's easier that we do know。

 And the disadvantage of this approach is that you lose the information of exactly what finite value it converges to and we're only able to conclude。

 yes， it converges， but we don't know what it converges to final thing I want to talk about is that this theorem only works one direction。

 the other direction it doesn't apply。 So for example。

 if you have the bigger function and the smaller function。

 you know that the smaller function converges。 It doesn't tell you anything about the bigger function。

 whether that converges that diverges Indeed， diverg in it is bigger than what。finite value。

 the smaller one convergees Likewise， if the bigger one diverges。

 the smaller one may diverge or it may converge， you don't know。

 So the comparison test only tells us when the big one converges。

 the small one converges and when the small one diverges， the big one diverges as well。
