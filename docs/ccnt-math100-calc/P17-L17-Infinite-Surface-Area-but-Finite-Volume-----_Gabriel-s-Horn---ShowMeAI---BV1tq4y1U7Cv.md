# P17ï¼šL17-Infinite Surface Area but Finite Volume!!   _Gabriel's Horn - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Todayï¼Œ we're going to talk about one of my favorite examples in all of calculusã€‚ Gabriel's hornã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the way this example works is I begin with the function1 over xã€‚

 and I'm considering this under the infinite domain of x equal to one all the way to X equal to infinityã€‚

 And then what I'm going to do is I'm going take this curveã€‚

 and I'm going to revolve it around the X axisã€‚ This is going to form a surfaceã€‚

 Now this looks a little bit like the horn of a trumpet or whateverã€‚

 But because going from one all the way to infinityï¼Œ there's this sort of infinite hornã€‚

 that's what we call Gabriel's hornã€‚ Nowï¼Œ I find this surface really interesting because of the following factã€‚

 there's two different types of things I might want to measureã€‚

 I might want to measure the surface area of this infinite horn or I might want to measure the volume that is inscribed within that surfaceã€‚

 These are two different computationsã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒNowï¼Œ when we first started with improper intervals where the domain was infiniteã€‚

 we saw that sometimes they converge and sometimes they divergedã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the magic of Gabriel's horn is that the surface area of this thingã€‚

 It actually diverges to infinityã€‚ It has an infinite surface areaã€‚

 the improper interval we will set up for it divergesã€‚

 but that the volume that is contained within this infinite surface area is somehow finite that it converges to a finite number over this infinite domain is really interestingã€‚

 So let's see how we can do thatã€‚ There are two different formulas that we have to describe these two different thingsã€‚

 The surface area and the volumeã€‚ The surface area formula we've just seen that in the previous videoã€‚

 the integral from me up to B of two pi F of xã€‚ I'm thinking that's my circumference with radius F of xã€‚

 And then multiplied by this little arc length thingã€‚

 the square root of the one plus the derivative squareã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒBack in calculus1ã€‚

 we had seen a formula for the volume of a region of revolutionã€‚

 and the formula we saw in calculus1 is it's the integral will of pi f of x squaredã€‚

The way we drive that formula is we thought of adding up a whole bunch of little disksã€‚

 width of all the little disks was Dxï¼Œ but the area of the disk was going to be pi the radius squaredã€‚

 So pi f of x squared in this caseã€‚ so let's actually compute them outã€‚ So for the first oneã€‚

 the surface areaï¼Œ let me plug in one up to infinityã€‚

 and I'll put in the specific function f of x equal to1 of xï¼Œ I plug that inã€‚

 and likewise I'll do that for my volume formula one up to infinity again and againã€‚

 the function one over x now squaredã€‚ let's do the surface area1 firstã€‚

 So this is an improp intervalã€‚ So I can use the comparison testã€‚

 If all I care about is whether it convers or whether it divergge is then I can use this comparison testã€‚

 So what I'm going to do is you see the big square root stuffã€‚ all of that is actually positiveã€‚

 I don't know exactly what the positive number is but it's always bigger than one because the derivative part is squaredã€‚

 and then you add that to oneã€‚ Soã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒFor sure something bigger than one So this improper interval that I have is bigger than the improper intervalable that's just2 pi1 over xã€‚

 but that's one I can do what was the definition of improper intervalsã€‚

 Well instead of the infinity up here in one of my limits of integrationã€‚

 I'm going to replace it with t and I'm going to put a limit as t goes to infinity out the frontã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then I can integrate1 over x is going to be logarithm and I can plug in the value of t which is always positiveã€‚

 I can plug in the value of one logarithm of 1 is0ã€‚

 and so I just get the limit as t goes to infinity of two pi logarithm of t and because of the shape of logarithm as t diverges logarithm does as well so this is just equal to infinity so this is my computation that the surface area of Gabriel's horn is infiniteã€‚

All rightï¼Œ wonderfulã€‚ But what about the volume it containsã€‚ Wellã€‚

 the volume was given by this formula hereã€‚ Nowï¼Œ againï¼Œ this is an improper integralalã€‚

 So by definitionï¼Œ this is the limitest t goes to infinity of 1 up to t of pi of1 over x squaredã€‚

 And then this is just something I can go and integrate what am I going to getã€‚

 the limitminest t goes to infinity of minus pi over x evaluated between t and 1ã€‚

 I can plug those numbers in and I can take t to infinity because the t's on the bottomã€‚

 it goes to 0ï¼Œ and I just get the value of piã€‚So this is kind of crazy what do I have in thisã€‚

 I have an infinite surface areaï¼Œ a surface area that diverges as you send the domain off to positive infinityã€‚

 but the volume that is inscribed within itï¼Œ that turns out to be exactly the value of piã€‚

So perhaps the big lesson here is that when we saw in proper intervalsã€‚

 we saw that sometimes they converge and sometimes they divergeã€‚

 it depended on the specifics of the functionã€‚ It depended on how fast they were collapsing down to0ã€‚

 So in this geometric problem when we're contrasting surface area and we're contrasting volume Indeed the intervals that come out of that the volume1 is compressing fast enough that it converges to pi while the surface area1 is not and diverges to infinityã€‚

 So I just think that's a really cool example I hope you enjoyedã€‚
