# P49ï¼šL49- The Definite Integral Part III - Evaluating From The Definition - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

Let's look once again at this idea of the area underneath function x squared between the values of0 and 1ã€‚

 in other wordsï¼Œ I want to figure out what is going to be my area underneath this functionã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_2.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_3.png)

Now what we've seen before is a couple thingsï¼Œ first of allã€‚

 we saw that we could approximate this by the sum of the areas of a bunch of different rectanglesã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_5.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_6.png)

And then we've seen sort of philosophically that the idea is that we're going to allow the number of rectangles to go to infinity is going to go have a better and better approximationã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_8.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_9.png)

But now what I want to do in this video is use that idea approximating by rectangles and taking the limit and goes to infinity to actually get a value for thisã€‚

 no longer an approximationï¼Œ but an actual number for itã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_11.png)

So I'm going to remind you that what we're doing in a different way of presenting it is a definite integralã€‚

 the integral from0 to1ï¼Œ that's where I'm going between of the function x squared dxã€‚

 and it's going to be written down as this computation we've done beforeã€‚

 the limit then goes to infinity of the sum of some Xi squared delta xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_13.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_14.png)

And what I need to do to actually compute this thingã€‚

 to actually make this thing be a number like seven or two or whatever the number is going to beã€‚

 we'll have to figure it outã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_16.png)

Is I need to determine what is the deelta Xï¼Œ I need to figure out what exactly are the X'sã€‚

 and then I hopefully will result in some sum that we're actually able to computeã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_18.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_19.png)

So let's do the deelta x's firstã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_21.png)

If I think about my interval is' from zero to oneã€‚And what I'm doing in my sum is I'm breaking this up into M different componentsã€‚

 so my interval is now going to be broken up into n sub intervaltersã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_23.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_24.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_25.png)

So what's the width of one of these sub intervaltervalsã€‚ I've got an original width of oneã€‚

 I've divided it into n different piecesã€‚ So I think the width is one over Mã€‚ In other wordsã€‚

 we can see that the deelta x is whatever the original interval was from 0 to1 or a width of one minus0 divided into n pieces that I just left with one over Mã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_27.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_28.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_29.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_30.png)

All rightã€‚What about the X I that I have hereã€‚ That's my next questionã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_32.png)

So if I have this XIï¼Œ what I want to figure out is some actual choice for itï¼Œ if it's up to meã€‚

 I could choose a left endpointï¼Œ a right endpointï¼Œ a midpointï¼Œ many different onesã€‚

 I'm going to choose the right end point and I'm going to try to write down a formula in terms of I for this particular right endpointã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_34.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_35.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_36.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_37.png)

And the way I want to think about this is I started zeroï¼Œ and then I go over one width one nã€‚

 and then I go over two widthï¼Œ so two n then I go over three widthï¼Œ so 3 n and in generalã€‚

 what I'm going to say is that my Xi is I go over I amounts times whatever that delta X wasã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_39.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_40.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_41.png)

Okayï¼Œ let's test to see if this formula makes sense if I chose I equal to1ï¼Œ so I'm looking at X Iã€‚

 it would just be with a delta x and that does make sense if I start at zeroã€‚

 then I'm saying I go over just one width and I'm going to the right endpointã€‚

 that's an amount deelta X overã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_43.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_44.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_45.png)

And then if I choose a two hereï¼Œ so it's twice delta xï¼Œ I'm saying I start at zeroã€‚

 I go over one delta xï¼Œ I go over a second delta xã€‚

 and that's the right end point of my second rectangle so I think this formula worksã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_47.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_48.png)

Okayï¼Œ so I've got this Delta Xã€‚ I've got this X Iã€‚ Let's take both of themã€‚

 and we're going to put them into my formula hereã€‚ So what I get for this areaï¼Œ the limit of the sumã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒIt's the X squaredã€‚ So I put in my X squaresã€‚And then it's the delta X that's the1 over nã€‚

 so I multiply it there and it's this big messy gnarly expressionã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_50.png)

All rightï¼Œ so we've made a decent amount of progress we've tried to compute this area and we've written it out as this limit of the sumã€‚

 the sum is now written entirely in terms of the ends and entirely in terms of the index variable Iã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_52.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_53.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_54.png)

But now I want to figure outï¼Œ can I actually figure out what this value is going to beã€‚

 do I know what number this is going to beï¼Ÿ

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_56.png)

Now the first way I can clean up this formula is note that the sum here depends on the index variable Iã€‚

 the sum doesn't depend on the nï¼Œ so I have a one over n squared hereï¼Œ I have a one over nã€‚

 I can pull all of those ns outside of my summationï¼Œ in other wordsã€‚

 I can clean it up and say the limit is n goes to infinity of1 over n cube times this sum from one up to n of I squaredã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_58.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_59.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_60.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_61.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_62.png)

Okayï¼Œ so what's the sum from  one up to n of I squaredï¼Ÿ



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_64.png)

Now I'm going to cite a fact for you and I'll put a link in the description of where you can go and find a proof for thisã€‚

 but the fact is this that sumï¼Œ the sum from one up to n of I squared is just equal to this nice expression n times n plus1 times 2 m plus1 all divided about by6 you can prove this with something called mathematical induction it is not really a part of calculus it's sort of an algebra proofã€‚

 so I'm going to pull out this fact for you that we have this here and I'm going to use thatã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_66.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_67.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_68.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_69.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_70.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_71.png)

To help me evaluate what I have right hereï¼Œ indeedã€‚

 I can say it's the limit as N goes to infinity of1 over N cubedã€‚

 and now I've just replaced my sum with this result here that I've claimed from my factã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_73.png)

All rightï¼Œ so let's actually try and compute this limitã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_75.png)

This is a limit that we should know how to doã€‚ It is a polynomial on the top and a polynomial on the bottom and we can ask if we're taking a limit at infinityã€‚

 what's the highest power on the top and the highest power on the bottom The bottom is pretty easy just n cubed and on the top here well there's an n there's an n plus1 and there's a two n plus1 so if I just look at the multiplication of those outã€‚

 the highest power is going to be n cubed and it's coefficient is11 and there's a two here so is a2 n cubed on the topã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_77.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_78.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_79.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_80.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_81.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_82.png)

And then factor in in the divided up by 6 that I have what I get is that this is just the limit n goes to infinity of2 n cubed on the topã€‚

6 n cubed on the bottom my end's cubed are going to go awayã€‚

 the two over6 last time I checked was just equal to the value of one thirdã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_84.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_85.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_86.png)

And now we have an answerï¼Œ this is the first time in the last couple of videos that we've actually managed to figure out what was the area underneath the curve x squared between the point0 and1ã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_88.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_89.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_90.png)

And notice that while we were doing rectangle approximationsã€‚

 if I use five rectangles or 10 rectangles or 100 rectanglesã€‚

 I could compute them all out of my calculatorï¼Œ that would be possibleã€‚



![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_92.png)

![](img/a10e81e3b7666d616b157c949cb189b8_93.png)

And you get a value that might be closeï¼Œ but it wouldn't be the exact valueã€‚ The claim hereã€‚

 the magic of the indefinite integral is that it gives you the exact value that by taking this limit of this particular sum and evaluating it correctly and using some algebraic tricks and going in and evaluate and limit the endã€‚

 it's a bit of a processï¼Œ but it gets us to an actual numberã€‚

 the area under x squared between 0 and 1 is equal to one thirdã€‚
