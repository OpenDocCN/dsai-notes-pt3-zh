。Consider a point like -11。 Now，-11。 Let's think about what those numbers do。

 They are points in a particular coordinate system。 The Cartesian coordinate system。

 where I tell you first， the -1 means whatever the X coordinate is。

 This case takes one step to the left。 And the plus1 that means the Y coordinate。

 it tells you to do one step up。 Now， what a coordinate system is is a way where you and I can agree on where points are supposed to be placed when I go and draw them。

 that the -11 is in a sense， an instruction that tells us where should I draw this。

 But the Cartesian coordinate system is not the only coordinate system out there。 In fact。

 there's many of them。 And what I'm going to show you when this video is called the polar coordinate system。

 So I'm going consider the exact same point， I'm not going to change that at all。

 It's the same point。 But what I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a little line segment from the origin out to this particular point。

😡，Now， because this point in Cartesian is at -11。 I can create a little triangle like this。

 It's a triangle where it has a side length of one and one。 and therefore。

 a hypoten used by Pythagoras of just square root of 2。 Now。

 if the only thing I told you was this number， the root2。

 when I said root 2 is the distance of the point away from the origin That wouldn't be enough for you to actually draw because this root 2 is actually part of an entire circle of points。

 All of these points are a distance root 2 from the origin。

 So I have to do a little bit more than that。 I have to tell you。

 not just the socalled radius of the circle， But I have to tell you the theta value。 Now。

 I need to give you a convention for this theta。 Let's agree on the follow。

If I start the origin and I go out some distance。 So imagine I've got the origin and I'm going go out here on the positive x axis。

 Then theta is the angle that happens when I rotate in the counterclockwise direction。

 So if I start here and I'm point in the positive axis。

 it comes up and I create some little angle of theta here。

 That is my positive axis in a counterclockwise rotation。 This， of course。

 is not the only choice maybe you could have chosen the negative axis maybe you could on a clockwise rotation。

 but we're going to agree on positive x axis， and then counterclockwise rotations。

 Well what is this value theta in this specific case。 Well。

 it actually breaks up into two different things。 remember was this 1，1 root 2 triangle。

 Well there's an inner angle， which is just this portion here inside of the triangle。

 which is pi over 4。 I know that because I know that the 1。

1 root 2 triangle that has an inner angle of pi over4。And then that's not the entire theta however。

 because there is also this portion in the first quadrant， but that's another region。

 another pi over 2 that comes from the positive x to the positive y and then goes from the positive y over a further pi over 4 So in other words。

 what do I have I have a radius of the root2 and I have an angle theta which is the sum of those two things pi over 2 and pi over 4 adds together to be three pi over 4。

😡，So here's the point。 If I tell you this radius and I tell you this theta。

 that is enough for you to figure out where I should draw the point。

 telling you the root2 tells you that it's somewhere on that circle。

 just you don't know where and then telling you the theta value tells you the exact place。

 the exact theta angle where it's going to occur。😡，Now。

 this coordinate system is a bit funky because there is not only one way to describe any particular point。

 the way there was only one way to describe the same point in the Cartesian coordinate system。

 For example， imagine I start here at this three pi over4。 and then I rotate one more time around。

 So that is I had the three pi over4。 And then I do an entire other rotation。

 And now where I'm at is three pi over4 plus two pi。

 right back at the same place because theta is so called two pi periodic。 if I go around by two pi。

 I end up exactly where I began。 or I could go around one more time again and I could end up at four pi。

 So three pi over4 plus four pi， it also describes the exact same point。😡，Or if you preferred。

 I could say that negative thetas refer to me going not counterclockwise， but clockwise。

 So for example， in this scenario I'm going to start at that positive X again。

 but I'd go clockwise when I do a clockwise theta， it is negative in this pace I've gone minus5 pi over4 and arrive back at the same point。

😡，Now what we typically do is to take these two numbers。

 the r and the theta and put it together into a coordinate like this。

 we say that r column of theta is equal to this root2 and in this example， minus5 pi over4。

 and those pair of numbers are my polar coordinates。😡。

And so the big moral lesson here is that I've got these two different coordinate systems。

 I've got this Cartesian coordinates。-11 is where this point lives in Cartesian。

 And then I also have all of these different polar coordinates。 The radius is root to。

 but their thetas might be different。 Let's generalize this a little bit。

 I've given a generic triangle here that starts at the origin。

 It has some angle of theta where it begins on the positive x axises and it rotates up some amount theta in the counterclockwise direction。

 This forms a triangle where I have a radius of R。 That's my hypotenus。

 And then there's an X and a y for my horizontal and vertical components。

Now there's a relationship between here， so the first relationship is about the R that obeys Pythagoras。

 which is to say that if I'm converting from Cartesian to polar。

 so you know the x and the Y and you want to find out the R in the theta。

 then I can find out the R by saying R is just the square root of x squared plus y squared。

 this is just Pythagoras。😡，Okay， well， what about the theta， Why don't I consider， for example。

 tangent of theta tangent of theta here is just going to be equal to y divided out by x。

 And if you prefer you can take a tangent of both sides。

 you could rewrite this as theta is a tangent of y over x。😡，So this means that if I have an X and Y。

 I can get out the R in the theta。 Okay， so now let me go the other way around。

 Supp I give you the polar coordinates， I give you the R， and I give you the theta。

 and I ask what are the Cartesian coordinates， What's the x and the y。 Well。

 consider first cosine of theta and sine of theta。 If I think about what cosine of theta is。

 So this is the adjacent over the hypotenuse， So it's going to be x over R。 And likewise。

 Y over R is going to be sine of theta。😡，I can then multiply up by the R。

 and I have two different formulas。 So x is R cos theta and y is R sine theta。

 So this is the conversion I need。 If you know the R and the theta。

 you can figure out now the X and the y。😡，Let's practice this in one example。

 So suppose that I have given you one square root 3。

 And I've told you that one square root 3 is in the Cartesian coordinate system。 And I'm asking。

 but how do I write that in polar， Note， by the way， I'm not moving the point around at all。

 The point stays in the same location relative to the origin。

 The only difference is how I present it， how I write it down。

 how I tell you an instruction on how to find that point。😡，Okay。

 so I need to do how about the radius first。 Well， the radius is the square root of the x squared plus the y squared。

 So I plugged that in。 The x is one， So one squared。 and then root 3， all squared。 Well。

 that square root of 4， which is just 2。And then finally， I want to figure out what my theta is。

 so I'm going to look at the theta is a tangent of the y over x so the root three over1。

 How do I figure out our tangent values？The main thing I do when I do trigonometry is that there's these two different special triangles that involve pi over3s and pi over sixs and then the other one involves pi over4s and that is the special triangle I use to figure out some of these funkyier trig values so for example the ones related that's got a root three in it is the one。

2 root3 triangle this is one where the one interior angle is exactly twice the other there's a pi over three and a pi over6。

And then if I consider tangent， remember theta is equal to arc tangent。

 so I'm going to consider tangent first and the question is， well。

 what value of theta has 10 of that value equaling root 3 over 1。 Well， in this case， it's pi over 3。

 indeed you took tangent of pi over 3， you get root 3 over 1。

 and therefore arc tangent of root 3 over1 is pi over 3 inverse functions。😡。

Well this is the one special triangle's put up just for your reference， the other special triangle。

 the 11 root two with interior angles， P 4 and P 4。

 these two triangles are both very important to have in your fingertips。😡。

Fal thing I want to talk about is writing down a grid in your respective coordinate system。

 So here I am back in Cartesian。 and I've put up like as if I was drawing this on some grid paper。

 So what is a grid line in coordinate system。 Well。

 one of these vertical grid lines is just me telling you what the x is one of the coordinates。

 I'm saying x is equal to0 x is equal to 1 x is equal to 2。

 And I give even spacing on my x or the horizontal ones。

 those are even spacing of fixed values of y Y equal to 0 y equal to1 Y equal to 2。😡。

So what a grid system looks like is just you taking the coordinates。

 you fixing special values of them that are sort of regularly spaced and drawing those special valued lines down。

 So how is this going to work out in polar coordinates。 Well， it looks a little bit cool， actually。

 but it's this。 So root 2，3 power over 4。 Our point lives here。

 but notice that what I've done is not change the point is changed in effect。 the grid paper。

 So these straight lines， these radial lines， Those occur at fixed values of。😊。

Theta of the angle that you're talking about So for example。

 I've put up here a lot of the special values pi over3， pi over 4， pi over 6 and so on。

 and so you can see that as you choose these special values， these nice fixed values of theta。

 then you're going to get a whole bunch of radial lines。😡，What about the circles。

 A circle represents a fixed value of R。 So in this example。

 I have these fixed values where R is equal to say one or a half。

 And that's going to create an entire circle。 It's the circle with that fixed radius。

 So the idea is the exact same thing with this grid system I've come up in polar coordinates。 Naly。

 all I'm doing is I'm fixing either fixed values of R or fixed values of theta。 It just。

 it looks a little bit different。 And you can use this to sort of help you sketch where a particular point ought to be。

😊。
