Welcome to my third video in my little series on complex numbers。 Well。

 in the first two videos in this series， we looked at the algebraic side of complex numbers and then the geometric side of complex numbers in this video。

 we're going to talk about something called the polar form of a complex number and a polar form is going to be really nice because it's going to very nicely capture the geometry of what's going on with complex numbers and really simplifyimified the kinds of computations that we might wish to do with complex numbers。

 So where were we Last time we seen that complex numbers could be represented as some length R times co theta plus I sine theta。

😊，And this representation of complex numbers was particularly nice because and this way of representing complex numbers was really nice because we could understand what was going on geometrically in a very transparent way。

 The R， the real number that's out the front， represented stretching by R。

 And what I mean by this if you take some complex number and then multiply it by this specific Z。😊。

The effect of that multiplication， well， the R portion of that said is a stretching in the complex plane。

 we also saw that the other portion the co theta plus the I sine theta， if you multiplied by Z。

 you took whatever you started with and you rotated it by an angle of theta and as such complex number multiplication was just some combination of stretches and rotations。

 that's what multiied but complex numbers were。😊，Now， I want to show you a very important formula。

 one of the most important formulas in mathematic called Euler's formula。😡。

what Uars formula does is clean up this presentation in some sense the formula says E the I theta is co theta plus I sine theta that is the exact same cos theta plus I sine theta that we saw in this way we represented Dar Z Uders formula is particularly nice if you plug in the value theta equal to pi then you get E the I pi is minus1 plus I times0 just minus1 and this formula is very aesthetically pleasing because it lets you relate many of the special numbers within mathematics all in one sort of formula that almost wouldn't possibly believe can be true Now in this video we're not going to prove this statement indeed this video is filmed in the contest of the calculus two course where later on in the course students will be exposed to infinite series and there's a standard proof of this using infinite series。

😊，I do want to note what is this exponential function I mean if it was E cubed。

 you would say that was e times E times E， but what do you mean by E to the power of I times theta So this has defined in what we call a series expansion。

 The idea is that e to the x is1 plus x plus x squared over 2 plus x cubed over 6 plus x to the fourth over4 factor over 24 and so on and so on and so on。

 it keeps up that basic pattern。The reason I like this series expansion is I can imagine plugging any number x into that series expansion now。

 I theta， for example， whatever that number turns out to be。

 I could just plug that in and square it or qubit or take Power for and so forth。😡，Okay。

 that's just a bit of an aside。 The thing we're really going to do in this video is use Euler's formula。

 So let's take the original Z， which was r times this trimetric stuff and collapse it down to this E to the I theta。

 That is， I'm going gonna to pull reform where my Z is now written as R times E to the I theta。

 In some sense， you can just think of Eer's formula as just a shorthand for this presentation that we've talked about previously for complex numbers。

 I'll also add two different pieces of terminology。

 One is that we'll talk about the magnitude of our complex number。

 which we'll denote by vertical bars。 And the magnitude of that complex number。

 is just going to be the value of R that's out the front。😊，Indeed。

 the E to the I theta part or alternative the co theta plus I sine theta part that lives on a unit circle and the radius of that unit circle is just one。

 so that doesn't really contribute to the magnitude。 So the magnitude is just， well。

 the coefficient R on the front。 And then the other piece of terminology is what we'll call the argument of the complex numbers Z。

 and that's just a different way of term the theta value that we've seen before。

 Okay so why do I like the polar form for complex numbers。 Well。

 one reason is I simplified a lot of computations。 for example。

 consider the following I want to multiply two different complex numbers both represented in polar form。

 So I've got a z1， which is an r1 E to the I theta 1。 And then I also have a Z2。

 which is an R2 E to the I theta 2。😊，So now let me try multiplying the two of them together。

The point here is that I can use rules about exponential functions， so for example。

 if you take the product of E to those something and e to something else。

Then you get the sum up in the exponent。 that is this is the same thing as the coefficients out the front。

 the R1 of the R2 can just be multiplied together。 And then in the exponent。

 it's e to the I theta1 plus theta 2。 Now we could actually do this without this convenience of polar form。

 In fact， we did this in the previous video where we took two different complex numbers represented by cos and sine for two different angles。

 we multiply them together。 There's a lot of trigonometry。

 some trig entitiesities came into play and it simplified to get the same idea that when you multiply by two different numbers with two different angles。

 the resulting complex number has the sum of those two angles it's theta1 plus theta2。

 It's just this exponential notation allows us to bury all of that sort of more complex trigonmetric stuff。

 So nevertheless we have that if you multiply two complex numbers。

 Then the complex number you get out of it。 The magnitude of it it's just r1 times R2。

 It's the product of the two magnitudes。 and then the argument。😊，The angle is just well。

 the sum of the previous two arguments So indeed the multiplication。

 these two complex numbers has this length， which is r1 times r2 so just the product of the two magnitudes of the individual complex numbers and then the argument or the angle of this new complex number that is the multiplication is just well it's just the sum of the two previous angles so let's just practice the conversion where we start with a complex number and we put into polar form。

 one example is root3 plus I how is it represented in polar form So if I visually look at what's going on here。

 I plugged in the point root 3 plus I on the complex plane so the horizontal represents real numbers and the vertical axis represents going up to imaginary numbers I can put that point root 3 plus ion on I draw sort of template circle that's got that radius and the real question is what is the radius so going from the origin00 out to my point。

3 plus I and then what is the angle with the positive x axis if I know the R， if I know the theta。

 then I'll have my polar representation Okay， so let me focus just on that triangle。

The base of that triangle because it's got a real component of root three is just root three。

 the height of that triangle because it's got an imaginary component of i times1 is height1。

And then just by Pythagoras， what is the hypoton use。

 it's the square root of one square plus root three squared in other words， two。

 So in this example the radius is 2。Okay， what about the argument， What about the theta value， Well。

 theta from this triangle， is a tangent of one over root 3。 and indeed。

 this triangle is one of those special triangle。 That's the one2 root 3 triangle。

 And I know that that special triangle has angle theta equal to pi over 6。

 And so then the polar form of this is going to be Z is 2 E to the I pi over 6。

 That's my polar reform representation of the complex number。

 which is represented originally as root 3 to I。😊，Let's see one more example and really try to illustrate it geometrically as to just how valuable the polar form can be In this final example。

 I want to consider the cubed root of minus1 the square root of minus1 was defined to be I。

 but what about the cube root of minus1？😡，Another way to think about this is that this is the solution to the equation x cubed equal to minus1。

 this is a third degree polynomial and as we saw in the first video on our series and complex numbers that the third degree polynomial by the fundamental theor of algebra ought to have three complex roots。

Well if you've seen this before， you might have said， well。

 minus1 is an answer because minus1 cubed gives you minus1。

 so you might say the answer to this is minus1。😡，However。

 if you recall the first video that we looked at the algebraic side of complex numbers。

 the fundamental theorem of calculus said that if you had a degree three polynomial。

 it would have three roots。Indeed， this is just the solution to the polynomial x cubed equal to -1。

 So we have one answer to it -1。 but we should be searching for two other complex answers。

 And how can we get this。 So I think I gonna to do is start with -1 and try to write the -1 in polar form。

 hoping that polar is gonna make things a little bit easier So I can take this -1。

 I haven't take it the cube root of it yet。 And I'll observe that 1 is， well。

 cosine of pi we give you 1 and sine of pi would give you0。 So this is just E to the I pi。

 Now the reason I like writing it in polar form is now I can take to the power of one third。

 which is the same thing as cube roots。 I can take that a little bit easier。

 So I can take the 1 to the one third。😊，And then I know how to take E to the I pi to the one third。

 it makes it E to the I pi divided by3 okay， that's one of the three answers。

 we'd already guessed minus one as being the other or why does that not appear here and how do we get the third Now the issue is that this polar reform actually has some periodicity to it。

😡，If I have some angle theta and then I take that theta and I add2 pi go the entire way around the circle。

 I end up exactly where I began。 So the point is that I can actually replace i pi with adding any number of two pi。

 So I'll write this as2 n pi or n is some integer。 So the point is the polar form of it is all the different ways I can write something within0 to2 pi because outside of0 to2 pi It's just repeating those values that were within0 to two pi by the periodicity of cosine and sine and thus likewise e to the I times theta。

 Okay so let me do the same thing when I take the division by 3。

 It's going to be pi plus2 n pi divided by3。😊，So the real question is when is this argument。

 this pi plus 2 n pi divided by3， when is that in0 to2 pi。

 which is the canonical way to represent somewhere in the first two pi circle。

 that's how I decide what my angled data is going to be Okay。

 well let's just try listing them for various values of n I'm going to have if n is equal to zero。

 it just pi referee。If n is equal to1， then it's pi plus 2 pi over 3， if n is2。

 then it's pi plus 4 pi over 3。If n is3， then I would end up with a number that was larger than two pi because I would end up with7 pi divided by 3。

 which is larger than two pi。 So， in fact， there's only three values of n 0，12。

 such that the resulting theta lies between 0 and two pi So all the other values of n are just going to repeat these numbers over and over and over again。

😡，Okay so this is really good three different angles which make sense because we thought there should be three solutions by the fundamental the algebra and then I just need to write them a little bit of a nicer way so I think what I'm going to do is say the polar form is that's E to the I pi over 3 that's the first of them。

The second one pi plus2 pi 3 pi 3 phi divided by by3 just pi so E to the I pi。

 And I'll note that E to the I pi as we saw above， was just -1。

 So the second one is exactly what we've seen previously。

 And then the final one is E to the5 pi divided by 3。

 All three of those are going to solve the equation x cube equals -13 roots to a degree3 polynomial so algebraically we've seen Y this is really nice。

 But let's go and try to take a look at what this means geometrically。

 So if I put up the plot here of the unit circle。 And Ive put on the yellow dot here to denote the number1。

 That's where it occurs one step to the left on the horizontal axis in the complex plane。

 that's the number -1 So I'm looking for the three values x where when you cubed them， you get 2 -1。

😊，Let's actually do the middle one first call the E to the i pi we had said was just equal to minus1 Okay so the way I visualize this and I' can take e to the i pi times e to the i pi times e to the i So the first one of them I can plug this in here。

 it just looks like well an angle of theta a length of one and e to the I pi gives you the value of minus1。

If I already have that and I multiply by EDI pi again， so minus1 times minus1 is plus1。

 it would then rotate another pi around the circle and would be back over to one as we suggested。😡。

And then if I multiply the third time， so 1 times 1 times minus1， a third time。

 it would take me back over to 1， which would be another rotation by pi。😡。

The point is I really think of this middle one as rotate by pi， rotate by pi rotate by pi again。

 that's going to take me up to minus1 Okay， now let's do the first ED the I pi over3 Well where is ED the I pi over three so they all have length one so they're all on the unit circle。

But pi over three has an angle well about there Okay。

 so what I'm trying to imagine is cubing this number。

 So I take this number multiply it three times And what that means is that each time when you multiply that you're rotating by an angle pi over3 so I start with one pi over3 I then rotate a second time and it moves over another pi over3 and then it moves over the third time another pi over three and takes me to 1。

And so thinking of these numbers as rotations， this is a way that I could rotate the same value three times and end up at minus1。

Okay， what about the third one， this E to the five pi over 3， Well。

5 pi over 3 is over here somewhere， so I'm going to be cuing it so I do it once it takes me over there。

I do it a second time it rotates a further5 pi over three around and takes me now down to here。

 And then I rotate a further5 pi over3 around again。 And this takes me finally to 1。

 So what we have here is a very pleasing geometric way to think about the three numbers that we algebraically solve using polar form。

 if you want to try and challenge yourself with another example why don't you try the cube root of I next and see if you can find algebraically the solution to the cube root of I Gemetrically predict where they should lie to cube out to getting to the value of I instead。

 All right， so that is polar form for complex numbers。 All right。

 if you enjoyed the video or found it useful， give a light for that YouTube algorithm where all mathematicians here。

 Re appreciateate algorithms just like YouTube does。 and we'll do some more math in the next video。😊。
