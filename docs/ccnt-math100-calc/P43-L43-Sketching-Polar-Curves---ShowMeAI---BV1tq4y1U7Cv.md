# P43ï¼šL43-Sketching Polar Curves - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to take a polar curveï¼Œ one that relates the R and theta in polar coordinatesã€‚

 For exampleï¼Œ r is1 plus cosine of thetaã€‚ And we're going to try to just sketch itã€‚

 We want to have a reliable way to be able to do thatã€‚ So how can I do thisã€‚ Wellã€‚

 one sort of brute force crude method is to just go and plot a whole bunch of pointsã€‚ So for exampleã€‚

 I have computed for a wide range of theta is what R of that theta is going to beã€‚ Soï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 theta is equal to 0ã€‚ You plug that into one plus cosine of0 and you get the value of twoã€‚

Some of the other points down on the list might seem a little bit hard to compute like actuallyã€‚

 what is cosine of5 pi over 4ã€‚ So let me just take one moment describe how I do thatã€‚

 My typical method is to use the unit circleã€‚ So I've drawn the unit circle of length1ã€‚

 And what I know is that if I put a point on that circleã€‚

 and I consider it horizontal and vertical componentsã€‚ Wellã€‚

 this forms a triangle and because it's a unit circleï¼Œ it's hypotenuseesis  oneã€‚

Then the horizontal and vertical components of this triangle are going to be cosine of theta and then sine in theta So for instanceã€‚

 if I plug in pi over4 enforcement it the hypoten uses one that's going to mean that the height and width of this thing which have to be the same because pi over4 makes an an isoscease triangleã€‚

 then this is going to be one over root2 and1 over root2 for the sine in the cosineã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So then to figure out wellï¼Œ what is cosine of pi over4ï¼Œ wellã€‚

 it's just going to be this value of one over root 2 divided by1 then one plus cosine so one plus one over root 2 okay that's fine And we talked about that in the pastã€‚

 but what about3 pi over4 So3 pi over4 is over here and for3 pi over4ã€‚

 you get basically the exact same triangle with one slight change is that the cosine the horizontal component is now negative in Pythagas doesn't matterã€‚

 the horizontal squared plus the vertical squared has to be equal to1ã€‚

 but if I think about just what the cosine is now the cosine is going to be minus1 over root2 and then1 plus cosine of the theta is going to be1 minus one over root2ã€‚

So the point here is that when I think about the unit circleï¼Œ I can take the pi over fourã€‚

 which I know wellã€‚And its corresponding thing in the second coordinate when theta is equal to3 pi over 4ã€‚

 and thereforeï¼Œ the inner angle of that triangle is a g pi over 4ã€‚ It's the same ratioã€‚

 It's just that the s may changeã€‚And then I think you can pause the video and see whether you can get the5 pi over four and the7 pi over four yourselfã€‚

But I'm going move on to try to plot this list of pointsã€‚ So how do I do thatã€‚ Nowã€‚

 there's actually two ways to plot this list of pointsï¼Œ One slightly more effective than the otherã€‚

 The sort of maybe older way that you might consider would beï¼Œ lookã€‚

 you know how to do plotting of points and Cartesianã€‚

 So you can take all of these theta R values that are in polarã€‚

 You could convert all of them to Cartesianã€‚ and then you can try to go and plot the Cartesian thingã€‚

 I would not recommend thatï¼Œ but I'm just pointing out you could do itã€‚

 what I'm going to do is I'm gonna to plot them as points in polar coordinatesã€‚

 So our method is going to be kind of like a connect the dots type thingã€‚

 I'm going show you how to plot all the dotsã€‚ All the green points here from this tableã€‚

 And then I'm going to show you how to think about connecting the dots to get the entire shapeã€‚

 Allrightï¼Œ So let's go point by pointsã€‚ So the first one I'm going to focus in on is theta equal to0 and r is equal to 2ã€‚

 So this is going to be this particular pointsã€‚ this20 hereã€‚ R is equal to 2 theta is equal to 0ã€‚

 the way I think about that is I am going to draw a half line thatã€‚

Starts at the origin and goes out at an angle of theta which is just right along the positive x axis so saying that theta is equal to zero tells me I'm somewhere along that line and because r is equal to  two it means I am two units along the line and so that's how I get to this 20ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ let's do a more interesting oneã€‚ Let's do the next oneã€‚

 So in the next one I'm talking about pi over 4ã€‚ So instead of having theta equal to 0ã€‚

 I now have theta equal to pi over 4ã€‚ and somewhere along that lineã€‚

 my point is going to lie in particular lies when R is1 plus one over root 2ã€‚

 Now root 2 is a little bit bigger than oneã€‚ So one over root 2 is a little bit less than oneã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So one plus one over root2 was a little bit less than twoã€‚

 so if you notice we started at a length of twoï¼Œ but when we rotated it up to pi over4ã€‚

 we got a little bit shorter in our Rsã€‚Lets keep on goingã€‚ Next up is theta is equal to pi over 2ã€‚

 So pi over 2 is now straight upï¼Œ and I'm going an even smaller radius up thereã€‚

 I'm only going one upã€‚ All rightï¼Œ next oneï¼Œ I'm going to three pi over 4ï¼Œ which lives over hereã€‚

 So I'm somewhere along that line of three pi over4 And in particularã€‚

 the length is this one minus1 of root2ã€‚ a smaller radius againã€‚

 And then absolutely final one here is going to be pi is equal to 0ã€‚

 So now I am lined up on the negative x axis theta is equal to piã€‚ And it tells me my radius is 0ã€‚

 But if you have a radius of 0 along this half lineï¼Œ means you're just right at the originã€‚Okayã€‚

 I'm going to let you pause and try to come up with the other four points yourself to see whether you can visualize where those go all rightã€‚

Now I'm going to do something a bit differentã€‚My goal is to recon those dots in a momentã€‚

 and I'm going to get thereã€‚ but what I'm going to plot for you is r equal to one plus cosine of thetaã€‚

 not as a polar curveã€‚ This is not the polar curveï¼Œ R equal to one plus cos thetaã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

This is what I would get if I just pretended that I was doing this in Cartesianã€‚

 if I gave you y is equal to1 plus cosine of xï¼Œ that's what you didã€‚

 If you treated this as a Cartesian thingï¼Œ so it looks just like cosineã€‚

 but instead of going between1 and minus1ï¼Œ it goes between 2 and zero because of the shift up by plus1ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen what I'm going to do on this sort of Cartesian version of the polar curveã€‚

 which is not my final answerã€‚ So I'm going to plug in all of my green dotsï¼Œ all of my pointsã€‚

 those my regular space values of thetaï¼Œ I think were pi over 4ï¼Œ pi over 2ï¼Œ3 pi over 4 and so onã€‚

 And I'm also going to color codedaã€‚ There's going to be a yellow region that goes between0 and pi over 2ã€‚

 a red region between pi over 2 and pi and so onã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Okay so now let's stop thinking about this as Cartesianï¼Œ we're going to do what we want to doã€‚

 which is to treat it as a polar curveã€‚ So we had the dots that we plugged in and figured out earlier now we're going to connect the dots and we're to talk about how to do thatã€‚

 Let's think about the yellow regionï¼Œ the region between zero and pi over 2 So this is where I start between theta equal to zero that is and I rotate up to theta equal to pi over 2 and I want to talk about how our changes as I go between these different theta valuesã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWellï¼Œ if I look at the plot of it in its Cartesian version that as you do this rotationã€‚

 you start from zero and you go up to pi over2ï¼Œ what's happening is that the radius starts at a length of two and then decreases and decreases so I can't make my arm shorterã€‚

 but instead of being a radius of two it's now half of that it's only a radius of1ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So let me see how that works when I fill in the dots hereã€‚ Watch how it goesã€‚

 I'm going to start with thetaï¼Œ I'm going to increase increase to up to pi over 2 and my radius as I did that rotation got smaller and smaller and smallerã€‚

 it started with a radius of 2ï¼Œ I was down at theta equal to  zero and it ended up with a radius of1 when I was up at theta equal to pi over 2ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAlrightï¼Œ let's continue carrying on connecting the dotsã€‚

 So now we're going to go into the red region between pi over2 and piã€‚

 so that is from straight vertical down all the way to pi on the negative x axisã€‚In this caseã€‚

 the radius starts at one and by the time it's rotated all the way down to theta equal to piã€‚

 the radius is all the way at zeroã€‚Okayï¼Œ so let's do thatã€‚ Let's continue our rotation as we plotã€‚

 So we're going to plug it in here and the red region it starts at a radius of 1ã€‚

 and it ends up at a radius of 0 right when you got that theta equal to pi valueã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒOkayï¼Œ next regionã€‚

 starting with theta equal to piï¼Œ and I'm going down to theta equal to three pi over  twoã€‚

 I'm in the pink in the pinkã€‚ Wellï¼Œ at piï¼Œ my radius is0ã€‚ if I look at my Cartesian plotã€‚

And then at3 pi over 2ï¼Œ my Rï¼Œ my height of the Cartesian or the radius in my polar has increased back up to 1ã€‚

 So as I go from here down to hereï¼Œ it starts at the origin R equal to 0 and goes out until such time as the radius is equal to one when it' all the way straight down at3 pi over 2ã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒFal regionã€‚ Now we're going to go into the blue region from3 pi over2 up to piã€‚

 So now we're starting down here and we're grading all the way back up to the positive axis again when we get to the de gulu2 piã€‚

 This is going from one down here all the way up to 2ã€‚

 And so we can fill it in and we get this nice little shape that we call a cardiooidã€‚

 If you imagine rotating this 90 degreesã€‚ So it was facing upã€‚ It kind of looks like a heartã€‚

 So we call it a cardiooidã€‚
