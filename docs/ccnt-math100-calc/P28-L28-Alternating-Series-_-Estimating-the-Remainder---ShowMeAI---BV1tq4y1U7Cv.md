# P28ï¼šL28-Alternating Series _ Estimating the Remainder - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

Suppose I have an alternating series like this oneã€‚

 This is the sum from I equal to 1 to infinity of -1 to the I -1 times some other positive decreasing sequence of limit 0 B sub Iã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ in my first video in alternating seriesï¼Œ we saw that if I put down the number lineã€‚

 there was this sort of back and forth behavior where the S1 was going to go all the way outã€‚

 And then the S2 was going to go back inã€‚ And then the S3 was going to go out and S4 back in and S 5 out and S 6 and S 7ã€‚

 And it just could back and forth and back and forth like thatã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then we concluded that the actual sum of the series was going to converge in this kind of caseã€‚

 and it was somewhere in the middle squash between this alternating behaviorã€‚ Nowã€‚

 let me suppose I've done thatã€‚ And I want to go and try to estimate this by perhaps only these first seven termsã€‚

 That is I have this seriesã€‚ And I want to go and write it as the sum of a partial sum S 7 and some remainderã€‚

 some error term R 7ã€‚Nowï¼Œ I don't know where exactly this sum isã€‚

 it could be anywhere in this particular regionï¼Œ but let me try to approximate it by sayï¼Œ the S7ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So the question is how good is this errorï¼Œ if I take this R7 is it a small number is it a big numberã€‚

 how can I control how bad my estimate of only taking the first seven terms is going to beï¼ŸðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNowã€‚

 to think about what this remainder could beï¼Œ we're currently at the S 7ã€‚

 and imagine we wanted to go from the S 7 out to an S 8ã€‚ Wellï¼Œ after we went out to the S8ã€‚

 we would then come back to an S 9 and go out to an S 10 and so onã€‚

 But based on the way that this collapsing works is the furthest I can ever get away from S 7ã€‚

 And the entire rest of the series is going to go to S 8ï¼Œ because after thatã€‚

 I'm going to get closer and closer and closerã€‚ That's the way this alternating series worksã€‚

 So whatever the remainder isï¼Œ I can definitely say that that R 7 is going to be less than the distance between S 8 and S 7ã€‚

 that is between the one term and the next oneã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd indeedã€‚

 the difference between S 7 and S is just whether I've added the8 term on is in this is just that B8ã€‚

 So in other wordsï¼Œ my R 7ï¼Œ my remainder when I take7 terms just bounded by whatever the8 term isã€‚

 in generalï¼Œ if I replace7 here with nï¼Œ I can say that my remainder of n terms is just going to be whatever the n plus1 term wasã€‚

 So let's see how this works out in a specific exampleã€‚

 So I've got-1 to the n -1 divided by n cubed hereã€‚

 and then I'm going to say that for my applicationï¼Œ I'm interested in accuracy of 0ã€‚001ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 how can I ensure that I have enough terms to get that accuracyã€‚

 Well if I look at my remainder is going to be if I want to estimate what R n wasã€‚

 what we've just seen is that I can bound that by the n plus one termã€‚

 what I want this n plus one term to be it is just remember one over n plus1 cubeã€‚

 I want that to be less than thisã€‚So now I have this relationship here that the one over n plus1 cube needs to be less than one over100ã€‚

 which is another way of saying 0ã€‚001ã€‚Okayï¼Œ this is an inequalityã€‚ so I can just multiply it upã€‚

 That's 1000 is less than n plus1 cubedã€‚ I can take the cubed root of both sidesã€‚

 I can get 10 is less than n plus1ã€‚ And finallyï¼Œ I can say that n is less than or equal to nã€‚

 So what does this tell meï¼Œ It tells me that as long as I take n as 9 or biggerã€‚

 then that ensures that whatever approximation I write out my 9 partial sumã€‚

 then that9 partial sum will be accurate to within 0ã€‚001ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the final point to make here is that in whatever application you may actually be doing in your future careersã€‚

 whether it's some engineering application or otherwiseã€‚

 there is going to be an uncertainty that comes from that different disciplineã€‚

 And the idea here is is it doesn't matter what the uncertainty is to calculusã€‚

 if you come in with the restriction you need it to be however certainty you wantã€‚

 you can use this to figure out how many terms you need to get that desired level of certaintyã€‚

Going back to Wolf fromelva do comã€‚ Let's go and try to compute out a few thingsã€‚

 I'm going to take the sum of the particular seriesï¼Œ which was the -1 to the power of n-1ã€‚

 and then all by n cubedã€‚ And what we want to do is take the approximation from 1 to 9 because 9 told us how many terms we are going needã€‚

 So I do that computation and what do I getï¼Œ it looks like a value of 0ã€‚902ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 this is only taking 9 termsã€‚ And what we guaranteed is that we are within ã€‚

001 of the correct answerã€‚ if I took the as many terms as I could possibly wantã€‚ And indeedã€‚

 let me just try just for fun hereï¼Œ how about instead of 1 to9ï¼Œ I just put in100 termsã€‚

 So this is gonna be a huge number of terms It's going take a little while for it to compute and there it goesã€‚

 So it says that if I'm going take 1000 termsï¼Œ it's 0ã€‚9015ï¼Œ which is yesã€‚

 not the exact same as the 0ã€‚902 we've seenã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

Beforeï¼Œ but it was within 0ã€‚001 of it indeed we can carry on and add more and more terms and we'd get more more accurateã€‚

 but I don't need any more than nine for this specific level of certaintyã€‚
