# P3ï¼šL3- A Tale of Three Functions _ Intro to Limits Part I - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this video we're going to investigate the idea of a limit and I'm going to introduce it to you by contrasting three different functionsã€‚

 F of x G of x and h of xï¼Œ and at least superficially they look a little bit different they've got different formulasã€‚

 but we want to see the degree to which these functions are really the same or whether they're in fact meaningfully different so let's study them each in term first up F of x equals x plus1 so I've given you the graph of this it's just going to be some straight line wonderfulã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNow I want to look at instead g of xï¼Œ which is x squared minus1 over x -1ã€‚

 whenever we have something like thisï¼Œ a polynomial on the top and a polynomial on the bottomã€‚

 I want you to have an alarm bell going off in your head that says can I factorã€‚

 can I perhaps cancel something from the top in the bottom So indeed if we try to factor x squared minus1ã€‚

 then what we're going to get is this is the same thing on the numerator as just x minus1 times x plus1 and then indeed we have this x minus1 on the bottomã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Nowï¼Œ if you were to just cancel the x minus1 and the x minus1 and on the top and the bottomã€‚

 if you just get rid of themï¼Œ what you'd be left with was x plus1ï¼Œ and if you just have x plus1ã€‚

 wellï¼Œ that indeed was precisely what we had for M of x x plus1 was just thatã€‚

So is this the same thing as F of x or is it a different thing from F of xï¼Ÿ

It's almost the same in my mindã€‚But there's a very slight differenceã€‚This function hereã€‚

 I can do this canceling whenever x minus1 is not zeroã€‚Indeedã€‚

 in that one case where x is equal to 1ï¼Œ and so the denominator x minus1 will be0ã€‚

 you have a division by zero and this function is not defined at that pointã€‚So when I draw its graphã€‚

 what I'm going to do is something like thisã€‚You see down here I have x equal to oneã€‚

 that was our problem spot that's the one spot where we've got this division by zero and x equal to oneã€‚

 the way I illustrated on the graph is this little circle with a hole in it and what that means is that this function is not defined at that particular pointã€‚

 there's just no value G of1 is undefined because you have this weird problemã€‚

So the graph is almost the same as the graph for F of xï¼Œ it's still the same straight lineã€‚

 but with the difference that this is not defined at that one pointï¼Œ and so the domainã€‚

 the allowable input values are very slightly differentã€‚Okayï¼Œ so F and G are a little differentã€‚

 but let's compare with Hã€‚Nowï¼Œ H is something called a piece wise defined functionã€‚

 And if you haven't seen this notation beforeï¼Œ what it means is thatã€‚

![](img/a0c3969bd8485415b048a4dd4db94a39_4.png)

You have two different possible functions that H is going to beã€‚

 and I tell you when they're going to be which of those two onesã€‚So for the exact value of oneã€‚

 it's going to be three and what this means is that h of one is equal to threeã€‚

But then if I have any other valueï¼Œ the H is just equal to x plus 1 and x plus 1 is that same function f of xã€‚

So how does this graph work againï¼Œ for most values except for x equal to 1 it's just the exact same thingã€‚

 it's that same straight lineã€‚Except at the one special point of one special because it being pulled out here that what you have is this point and I fill in the dot to say that's where the point is and it's got this height of three coming from the three in my formula so this socalled piecewise defined function again let's very very similar to f of x but a little bit different and a little bit different from G of x as well G of X only had the open hole but did not have the closed in dotã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo now if I go back to my three different functions we're talking aboutï¼Œ wellã€‚

 the way to analyze them is they are the same everywhere except at oneã€‚

 because F of one is two and G of1 wasn't even defined there just was a division by zero it didn't work out and then H of one is the value of threeã€‚

 so these functions are different at the 01 but other than that they are going to be the sameã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
