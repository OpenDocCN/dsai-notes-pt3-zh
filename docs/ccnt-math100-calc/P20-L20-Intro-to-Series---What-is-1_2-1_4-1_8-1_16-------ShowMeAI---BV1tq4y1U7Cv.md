# P20ï¼šL20-Intro to Series - What is 1_2+1_4+1_8+1_16+... - ShowMeAI - BV1tq4y1U7Cv

ã€‚Suppose I want to walk along this particular lineã€‚

 One way that I could choose to restrict my path of walking along this line is to say that firstã€‚

 I'm going to go halfway from the one edge to the otherã€‚ So I'll just go half the distanceã€‚

 And then I'm halfway to my destinationï¼Œ and maybe I'll restrict againï¼Œ and I'll sayï¼Œ I can againã€‚

 only go half of my remaining distanceï¼Œ which is now one quarter of the originalã€‚

 So now I've gone the one half plus a quarter of the total distanceã€‚

 And then I'll go one8 of the total distanceï¼Œ A Kï¼Œ A 1 half of the remaining distanceï¼Œ then one 16thã€‚

 then oneï¼Œ30 secondï¼Œ and so onã€‚ Then the question isã€‚

 if I restrict myself in this way where I only go half half halfã€‚

 do I ever manage to get from one side all the way to the otherã€‚Nowï¼Œ one way to think about this isã€‚

 first of allï¼Œ I have a list of numbersï¼Œ which is just a sequence as we've seen beforeã€‚ That isã€‚

 I have this one halfï¼Œ this one quarterï¼Œ this one8th and so onã€‚

 But I'm not really interested in just the sequenceï¼Œ just this list of numbersã€‚ I'm in a senseã€‚

 interested in adding them all upã€‚ Does the one half plus the one quarter plus the one8 is all of that add up to some particular numberã€‚

 perhaps oneï¼Œ the full length of this particular distanceã€‚ Wellã€‚

 that is something not called a sequenceï¼Œ but called a seriesã€‚

 a series is when you take a sequence and you add up all of the termsã€‚ You don't just list themã€‚

 you add them togetherã€‚ And if our notation for a sequence with to say some formula like an N is say in this caseã€‚

 one half to the power of nã€‚ Then for a seriesã€‚ Our notation is to put a sigma of the frontã€‚

 a summation signï¼Œ we say that the series is the sum from n equal to one up to infinity of the sequence a sub nã€‚

 So in this caseã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒThe sum from n equal to  one up to infinity of this one half to the power of nã€‚

 And what this notation just means when you see this big sigmaï¼Œ When you see these ends hereã€‚

 they are an instruction of how you add things togetherã€‚ Firstï¼Œ you add in when you plug in oneã€‚

 That's the value of a halfã€‚ Then you add to that plugging in n equal to twoã€‚

 which is the value of a quarterã€‚ then you add in plugging in n equal to three and so onã€‚ Nowã€‚

 you might conjecture that the sum of all of these numbers is perhaps just oneã€‚ Indeedã€‚

 you might sayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ yesï¼Œ ifs infinitely many stepsï¼Œ we're going to start or we start upã€‚

 and we're going to end at that goalã€‚ this spot that we've been going always half the remaining distance towardsã€‚

But is that really trueï¼Œ And can we define some notion of this infinite sum that is consistent and make sense to usã€‚

 And can we prove that for that definitionï¼Œ that indeedï¼Œ this is going to be equal to oneã€‚

 And even thenï¼Œ if you're convinced about the situation for one halfã€‚

 What about if I restrict myself to sayingï¼Œ and I go one third of the way to my destinationã€‚

 then one third again and then one third againã€‚ I can change all of this here to have powers of one thirdpo to powers of one halfã€‚

 But then againï¼Œ are you as confident that the sum of this is now oneï¼Œ maybe it's some other valueã€‚

Okayï¼Œ so let's step back a little bit and try to precisely define what we're talking about when we talk about series and adding up some particular sequenceã€‚

What I'm going to begin with is that the sum of a generic sequence a sub nã€‚ So A N is a sequenceã€‚

 and I'm taking the sum of it is just adding the first term to the second term to the third term and so onã€‚

And we're trying to figure out whether this converges in some meaningful sense to a numberã€‚

 Perhaps the number oneã€‚ Nowï¼Œ one of the things I can study is something called the partial sums of thisã€‚

 So consider this sequenceã€‚ This is the sequence S sub nã€‚ And S sub n is a bit differentã€‚

 It's not an infinite seriesã€‚ It is a finite sumï¼Œ it's only considers the first n termã€‚

 So S sub n is a1ï¼Œ A2ï¼Œ A3 all the way down to a sub nã€‚ for instanceï¼Œ if I go and try to compute S1ã€‚

 Well S1 is sum of the firstï¼Œ wellï¼Œ only one termã€‚ S2 is a sum of the first two termsã€‚ So a1 plus a2ã€‚

 S 3 is a sum of the first three termsï¼Œ A1ï¼Œ A2ï¼Œ A3ï¼Œ and so on for S 4ï¼Œ so on for S 5ã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the real point here is that these partial sumsã€‚ The S sub nã€‚ that is not a seriesï¼Œ it is a sequenceã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ for any one of these individual S subã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼Œit is just sum numberã€‚ you add up n terms togetherã€‚

 You get some numberã€‚ So for every natural number that we haveã€‚

 we have a value out for this partial sumã€‚ That's what we're talking aboutã€‚

 So the way this is going to work is that I am going to use these partial sums to define my notion of convergenceã€‚

 Indeedï¼Œ what I'm going to say is that the series itself self convergenceã€‚

 the sum of the an is equal to Lã€‚ if the limit of the sequence of the partial sums is going to be equal to Lã€‚

 and note here that we have already defined in the previous videosã€‚

 the notion of the limit of a sequenceã€‚ So the limit is n goes to infinity of the sequence Sn being Lã€‚

 that is a notion of convergenceï¼Œ we understand the notion of a series converging to Lã€‚

 we didn't previously had thatã€‚ And this is the definitionï¼Œ It saysï¼Œ let's look at the partial sumsã€‚

 let's look say adding the first million terms and the first billion termsï¼Œ the first trillion termsã€‚

 as long as you wish where you're investigating these partial sumsã€‚ Wellï¼Œ if those partial sumsã€‚

Or approaching some valueï¼Œ that is our definition of the convergence of the seriesã€‚
