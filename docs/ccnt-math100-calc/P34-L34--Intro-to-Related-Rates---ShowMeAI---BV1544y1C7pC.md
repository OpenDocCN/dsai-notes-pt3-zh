# P34：L34- Intro to Related Rates - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In mathematics， an equation of multiple variables is going to give a relationship between two or three or four different variables Now。

 in the idea of related rates， which is what we're going to be talking about in this video。

 what we're going to describe is not a relationship between the variables themselves。

 but a relationship between the rates that come out。 So let me give you a specific example。

 I'm going to give you a word problem and we're going to be interested in how one rate is related to a different rate。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_5.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_6.png)

In this problem I want to imagine you've got two different cars and they're both going off and they're driving and the first of the car has gone and driven 0。

4 miles east and then you've got a second car that started at the same spot that you have here。

 but it's driving north and it's driven 0。3 miles north。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_8.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_9.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_10.png)

Now this is a picture that demonstrates some information about the world and we can ask questions about how these are going to be related and one way that we can ask question is what about the distance that goes between these two points。

 how far away are these two cars if they're both have driven in this amount。

 there's this relationship D here。😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_12.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_13.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_14.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_15.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_16.png)

And I can find some equation that expresses this， this is just a right triangle I can use Pythagoras。

 and I can claim that the distance squared here is going to be equal to the y squared plus the x squared。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_18.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_19.png)

So this is just the Pythagorean relationship between these three different variables and then since I know what the car A is driven。

 the 0。4 miles and I know what the car B is driven， the 0。3 miles。

 I can plug those numbers into my equation and I can get that the distance between them is going to be a half mile。

😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_21.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_22.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_23.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_24.png)

Allright， so this expressed the relationship， but not amongst the rates。

 amongst the original quantities， the X， the y and the D。 And indeed。

 this relationship was that it this specific time， the specific time when it was 0。4 miles and 0。

3 miles， but I could also ask the question， what would this look like as a function of time。

 if I'm imagining that my car continues to move and my car B continues to move。

 how does my distance change as a function of time So let me add some more information to this picture。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_26.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_27.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_28.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_29.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_30.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_31.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_32.png)

I want to describe how it is that my cars are changing with respect to time。

 So what I'm going to say is that my car B is traveling north at 50 miles hour and that my car A is traveling east at 60 milesph。

 So we have this specific time where there's the specific distance they've already traveled。

 but that they're going at some velocity in this case， the 60 and 50 miles hour。😡。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_34.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_35.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_36.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_37.png)

Now if I think about this equation， which is an equation of T and if I get rid of all of my other information for a moment。

 it's some function of T so I can take a derivative。

 I can take the derivative to the left with respect to T and I can take the derivative of the right with respect to T。

 and so I'm going to pop out and say that we've got the derivative respect to T of the left and the right。

😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_39.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_40.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_41.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_42.png)

Now， I can do this derivative。 these are actually relatively simple functions。

 If I have the distance squared， then I'm going to apply the chain rule。

 and it's going to be twice the distance times D prime。 and the same as we go along。

 So I'm going to say twice the distance D prime twice the distance。 But now it's x。

 So twice the X X prime and twice the y， Y prime。 That's applying the chain rule and the power rule to all of these variables to the power of two。

😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_44.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_45.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_46.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_47.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_48.png)

Now what's interesting about this equation that we have down here is I want you to note that it is relating the original variables。

 the D， the X and the Y， we can see that those are there。

 but it's also relating the derivatives of those variables， it's also relating the D prime。

 the x prime and the y prime。😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_50.png)

If I'm really interested in the question， what is the rate of change of the distance between the two cars I might be most interested in figuring out what the D prime is。

 then what I can do is I can rearrange this formula and by dividing out the 2D。

 I get that the D prime is just going to be equal to the xx prime plus the yy prime all divided by the D and I've canceled out the twos。

😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_52.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_53.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_54.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_55.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_56.png)

Okay， so we've got to this formula by taking the derivative of our original Pythagorean equation。

 so I want to focus this， but now I want to plug in my number。

 so let me keep that up there and remind ourselves that we had this scenario where we had the original y was 0。

3， the y prime being the 50 the original x value the 0。

4 and the x prime the 60 and so what we get plugging these numbers in is this expression where for the distance as a function of time I've put in the 0。

5 that we computed previously。😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_58.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_59.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_60.png)

And then if I actually go into my calculator， I can decide this number is going to be 78 miles per hour。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_62.png)

So what we've accomplished is that I have figured out de prime of T。

 which is telling me that this distance， the distance between the two cars。

 the distance as a bird will fly， that that is changing at this rate of 78 miles per hour。

 this is a derivative， it is a rate， it is a miles per hour and we have managed to be able to compute that。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_64.png)

Alright so the major steps in these related rate problems will be more or less the same。

 even if the specific picture is going to change so the steps as I see it are for related rates problem。

 the first thing is if I give you some word problem。

 you have to understand you have to be able to sort of visualize it so the first step that we would always do is just sketch some picture。

 but if that's what we did in this particular example， we sketched where CA A was， where Car B was。

 what this distant was we got this nice visual representation of it。😡。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_66.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_67.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_68.png)

And then after you have that nice picture， what you can do is you can try to find some equation that's going to be relating the variables that we're interested in in this case。

 it was going to be this relationship that the d squared was the x squared plus the y squares that comes from pyphaaggraas。

😡。

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_70.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_71.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_72.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_73.png)

But for a different problem with a different picture。

 the relationship between the variables might be somewhat different。

 but either way you want to find some equation that relates those original variables。😡。



![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_75.png)

![](img/7306518b583ccfe101f9e807e8e42842_76.png)

That's not quite enough because we want to be able to differentiate to get a relate。

 we want to relate our rate so we're going to take the derivative of whatever we have and that's what we did here where I went and found that my deprive of T was some particular function and then after I've got my function I'm not interested just in what the equation is I want to know what it is at some specific values of data and so I can go and sub them whatever the values and that was how I eventually got down to the 78 miles per。

😡。
