Consider the graph of e to the x if I wanted to compute a value like say e to the 0。2。

 well I could do that， I could go to some calculator and just plug it in。

 but how does the calculator know what E to the 0。2 is？😡，In today's video。

 we're going to talk about one of the most powerful theorems in all of calculus and perhaps all of mathematics。

 Taylor's theorem。 It's the way that an enormous amount of mathematics actually works and is actually done behind the scenes in computers and in the real world。

 It's going to be incredibly important for us。 The ideas we want to figure out how to do approximations in a more sophisticated way we've done in the past。

😊，For example， imagine that you're in high school and you don't know calculus。

 you get have to figure out well， what is E to the 0。2。 One of the things that you could do is say。

 look， E to the 0 is a number that， you know， E to the 0 is just one。

 So what have I considered instead of E to the x， just Y equal to1， the constant function 1。 Now。

 approximating E to the 0。2 by1。 It's not bad。 there's a sort of like little error that remains here。

 It's not that gross of an error。 but if I consider E somewhere larger and further away from 0。 Well。

 this error grows to be really， really large and it grows to be large pretty quickly。But in calculus。

 we developed a better way to do this。 We had the idea of a linear approximation。

 So instead of a constant function， a constant line。

 what we're going to do instead is have a tangent line。

 now for this tangent line are approximations are actually quite a bit better。

 It is a better approximation。 And the closer that you go to wherever you've put the tangent line。

 in this case， it's a tangent line at 0。 The better your approximation get。

 So this tangent line is pretty good。 But can we do better than that。

 can we do better than just a linear approximation。 For example。

 imagine I instead try to put a quadratic， not a line。

 a quadratic as the thing that was going to approximate E to the x around the value of x equal to 0。

 maybe it would look a little bit like this one， whereas I curl it up。 And I put in a quadratic。

 And I make the quadratic， just touch at the point of x equal to 0。

 and to have a very similar slope and it just it really。😊。

aligns and now my error is actually pretty good。 There's almost no space that I can visualize at all。

 And if I can do that for a quadratic， I can do the same kind of things for a cubic。

 It becomes an even better approximation， and I can even go further to a quatic or however along you want to do as many terms as you might wish。

 but。😡，How do I come up with these polynomials that so nicely approximate in some little region？

 How do I know whether this is the best a polynomial to approximate with。

 and how good of an approximation really isn't。 Well。

 that is going to be the core of our study of Taylor series。

 And then if I want to put all of these on top of each other， I have the blue E to the X。

 and I put the constant， the linear， the quadratic。

 the cubic and the quattic approximations all on the screen。

 And what you can see is that the higher the degree of the polynomial， for example， the quatex。

 the better the approximation becomes。 All right， so let's go all the way back to linearization。

 when we just approximate it with the tangent line。

 let's remember what we did there and then we're going to generalize。

 So the first thing we say that when I'm doing a tangent line is that at the value of x equal to0。

 the spot where my tangent line is at。 I'm saying that the function and the tangent line have the same actual value。

 They're Y or the same。😊，Also， they have the same slope So those are my two different considerations。

 So for example， if I compare E to the x the function that I have and a generic linear。

 a generic linear of the form c0 plus c1 x， that's what I mean by a completely generic linear function then the first thing I want to do is say that at the value of x equal to0。

 they're exactly equal。 So I can plug in x equal to0。😡，E to the 0 is 1。 C1 times 0 would be 0。

 That just leaves me with c 0 being1。 Okay， not so bad。 So I can put that in。

 Now I've got one plus some constant times x and and E to the X， these is what I'm gonna compare。

 But then what I'm going to do is take the slope being equal。 Now。

 the slopes mean take the derivative。 So I'll take the derivative of both。

 And then if I plug 0 into that。 E to the0 is again，1 and might get that our C1 is1 as well。

 So what do we have our approximation is then that this E to the x is been approximated by1 plus x。

 which is not as say that they're exactly equal。 Indeed。

 far away from the value of 0 that becomes a worse and worse approximation。 But nearby， it's not bad。

 slightly more generally the linear approximation is going to be that f of x is approximately f of 0 plus the derivative of 0 all times X。

 And I'll let you recall how we did that and calculate give us1。

 It's the same idea of what we just walked through。😊，Well， now let's go up to degree2 polynomia。

 So instead of just this tangent line， I'm going to go and try to approximate it by a quadratic。

 And the restrictions are going to be the same two initial ones。

 It has the same Y value and it has the same slope。 But in addition。

 I'm going to demand that it has the same concavity that when I've got this quadratic。

 it's got three different restrictions on it。😡，Then a generic quadratic can be written as a C0 plus a C1 x plus a C2 x squared。

 which is to say a generic polynomial with three different coefficients。

 I've got three different conditions。 I think it's going to work out。

 So same story that we did before， let's first plug in the x equal to0。

 If I do this most of the polynomial goes away and you get either0， which is one is just your C0。

 So I can replace my c0 with that one for my polynomial。Now。

 I'm going to take the derivative because I want the slopes to be equal on these two things。 Again。

 I will say that this is at 0。 So it's my slope being equal at x equal to 0。

 So I'm going to plug in 0， and I get e to the 0， which is one。Is C1 plus a bunch of stuff。

 which is0。 So that tells me my C1 now is also going to be equal to the value of 1。

 So I'll replace everywhere where there's a C1 with a1。Now I want to look at concavity。

 which is the second derivative。 So I take the derivative one more time。 I plug in x equal to 0。

 and what do I get E to 0 is1 yet again。 So C2 is one half。

And I can replace all the C2s with one/hals。Which is to say that what I have is this polynomial here。

 this one plus x plus1 half x squared。 that is how I came up with the quadratic that is going to well approximate near the value of x equal to 0。

 this is how I did it for E to the X。 But let's take that idea and let's generalize it。

 let's do it for all functions， at least functions that have power series。 That is。

 I take a generic f of x， And I said it equal to a power series and say that this converges for some radius。

 And the question is， what are the coefficients。 What are the c0 to C1 n so on。 Well。

 let's take a few derivatives， as I did in my example with my quadratic。 In that case。

 first derivative is going to mean that my c0 term goes away。 My C1 x term becomes just C1。

 And then x squared to2 comes down x cubed to 3 comes down and so on。 in general， the n term。

 the C X to the N。 the N comes down and'm left with this n Cn x to the n minus1。

Let's do one more derivative。 So now I'm going to knock out the C1。 The 2 C2 is all that remains。

 And then in the term that started is x cubed， first， the three went down。

 and now the two goes down I'm not multiplied by x。 But go to that nth term。 First， the n came down。

 the first derivative Now in the second and n -1 comes down。

I'm going to step away for a moment because there's not enough room。

 But if I take the n derivative now， Well， all the lower order terms。

 the terms where the power of x was less than。 and all of those have had enough derivatives that they go to 0。

For the n term itself， the x to the n， Well first hang down the n， then the n -1， then the n -2。

 in general， this is an n factorial when I do at n times。 That's just multiplied by the C N。

 X goes away。And then I have a whole bunch of more higher order terms where the X's remain。Now。

 after taking derivatives， Well， what did we do previously， we plugged it in x equal to 0。

 So let's everywhere there's an X。 I'm going to replace this with a 0。

 And now this gives me a series of equations。 I can compute what all the different C values are。

 So for the first line， every single thing， except for C 0 is indeed 0。 So C 0 just F of 0。

 for the second， everything about the first remaining coefficient。 C1 is 0。

 So C1 is just F prime at 0。 C 2 is F double prime at 0 over 2。

 and generically C N is you take n derivatives of it。😊。

And then you divide out by this n factorial thing to make a balance。 By the way。

 these first few terms I can interpret in the language of factorial。0 factorial is just  one。

1 factorial is just  one，2 factorial is just2， so I can replace those coefficients in the denominator。

 And so it's quite compatible with a generic form， you take n derivatives and divide it by n factorial。

 Indeed， a McLain series is one where you're doing a power series around x equal to 0。

 You compute out what the coefficients are。 And indeed you get precisely this。

 These n derivatives at 0 divided by n factorial。 The fact that I plugged in x equal to 0 here is。

 in a sense unportant。 I can actually just shift this。 So everywhere there's a0。

 I can put it in in a。 So it's x minus a and the radius is the absolute value of x minus a less than R。

 And the derivatives of value added A。 So it's just a slight shift And in that more general case。

 I call it a Taylor series。 a McLain series where a is0 is just a special case of the true thing。😊。

Taylor series。Okay， so let's look at that example that we had before。 we started with E to the x。

 and I'm doing it around a equal to 0，0 is the spot where I'm approximating it。

Then if I plug into my big gnarly formula， all right， in place of the n derivative。

 I've written it down here in Leith notation， the n derivative of E to Vx evaluated at0。😡。

For E to the x， the first derivative is E to the x。

 the second derivative is E to the x is e to the x is all the way along。

 so it's just E to the S when I take end derivatives。Pluinating 0。 it's e to the 0， which is one。

 So all of that mass goes away。 And I'm just left with x to the n over n factorial。

 So this is the Taylor series 4 E to the x。 final thing I want to do is show up the graph now of cosine with its first and second Taylor polynomial approximation。

 So this is the blue cosine。 and then I have the tangent line to cosine。

 which is just the line y equal to1。 And the quadratic approximation。

 which is one minus x squared over 2。 Now， what I want to notice that this critically depends on the fact that I am doing this approximation about a equal to 0。

 Indeed， these approximations look pretty good for values near 0。 the quadratic one in particular。

 But far away， I mean， quadratic is dropping off to minus infinity far away。

 It's going to be a terrible approximation。 Now， what is fascinating Taylor series to me is that the computation only depended the derivative exactly at the point A equal to 。

😊，That's the only thing you needed to know。But when I graph these， it's a pretty good approximation。

 not exactly at zero， but nearby， there's a sort of whole region where it's pretty nice。

 We haven't quantified yet exactly what we mean by pretty nice being a good approximation。

 But the general idea that you're using information all taken at one point to get an approximation nearby。

 you get local information from this exactly one point is an incredibly powerful and broad idea。

 And indeed， if I now change that point。 So instead of a to0， let's just move it over。

 let's move it down to a equal to pi。You can see how the quadratic and the linear approximations change with it。

 you get now a different quadratic that approximates this at this different point and near the value of a to pi is pretty good indeed a polynomial has an x minus pi squared in it。

 this is centered at the value of pi So Taylor series takes information at a point a specific A and gives you information nearby that particular value of A it gives you local information。

😡。
