The function E to the x is a very important very famous function within mathematics and indeed it has this interesting property which is that the derivative of e to the x is just the same function that is if I take a point like how about one here all right so one E to the one is going to have the value just E E to the one is E and so if I f out what the slope is that the height of this which looks like a little bit over2 basically the value of E here is the same thing as the slope of this particular function that they have the same function value and slope and indeed if I taken my slope down here or my slope up here it doesn't really matter it's always going to have the same slope as the function value。

😡，Indeed， you could ask a broader category like there's all these different exponents。

 like two to the x and 3 to the x and pi to the X and 100 to the x。E to the X is defined to be。

 or one way you can define it to be is define to be the number such that the derivative of E to the x is itself。

 we define E to be the number where this property is true。

 So we really are going to like exponentials as we go forward in our course。

 and they have this really nice property。 Indeed， what you can do is take the derivative of the derivative of E to the X。

 First derivative takes you E to the X。 Second derivative takes you to E to the X。

 You take 100 derivatives in a row。 You get back to E to the X and so forth。So where are we at？

We now know how to take the derivatives of two different types of functions。

 the derivatives of an exponential like e to the x， and the derivative of a power like x to the n。

So we've got those sort of two like baseline kind of functions and then the addivity in the scalar multiplication。

 those are ways that I can combine them。 So for example， I could have a polynomial。

 which is a bunch of power rules， or can I have like Ev x plus x squared and I would be able to combine them by these different rules So we haven't got all functions by any means。

 but we're developing so far a decent list。😡。
