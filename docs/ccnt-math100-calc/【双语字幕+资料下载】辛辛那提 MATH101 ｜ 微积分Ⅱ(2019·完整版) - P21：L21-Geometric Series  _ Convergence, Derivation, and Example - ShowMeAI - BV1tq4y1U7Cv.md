AGmetric series in general is a summation。 So a series of some constant a。

 just a multipl of constant。 But then there is some ratio R to the power of n -1。 So， for example。

 if we express out the first few terms of this， the first one is plugging in n equal to one。

 So R to the0 is one， just a。And then when you plug an n equal to  two。

 you get R to the power of one。 So A R and so on。 And so far。

 we've seen examples where R was one half or R was one third。

 But we can do this generally for arbitrary R。 Now， does this converge as this diverge。

 Does it depend on the parameters。 Well， consider this。 I want to investigate the partial sum。

 So let me do this。 I'll write down S sub n the partial sum And the n partial sum is the sum of A plus A R all the way up to A R to the n -1。

 Now I'm gonna perform a little algebra trickier。 Let me take this S N。 and let me multiply R to it。

 isn in let me consider R times S N。 So A turns into a times R。

 A R turns into a times R squared all the way along the final one is A R to the N。Now。

 I've got this S N。 and I've got R times。 it let me take the difference。

 Let me look at what the partial sum minus R times the partial sum is going to be。Indeed。

 this is plugging in for the SN that's going to move down。

 and then I take the RSN and I subtract that off。 Now， there is an enormous amount of cancellation。

 For example， you see how that there is a plus AR and a minus AR。 Well。

 then those two terms are just going to cancel。😡，There's a plus A R squared a minus A squared。

 Those terms are going to cancel Some in the dot dot dot， there'd be a positive A cubed。

 and there's a minus A cubed。 So that cancels。 And finally。

 also in the dot dot dot is going to be a subtraction of A R to the n -1。

 that will cancel the A R to the n -1。😊，So what do I actually have left over here。

 The only thing that remains is going to be the A and the A R to the N。 So this difference。

 which I will factor out， the Sn comes out the front。

 The partial sum1 minus R is just equal to a minus A R to the N。Now， if I focus on a special case。

 this is the case where r is not equal to1， then I can divide out by1 minus r and just get that my partial sum is a minus a to the R divided out by1 minus R。

😡，Of course， if R is equal to one， I can't do that。

 I'll talk about that a little bit more in a moment。Now。

 what I'm investigating is does this series converge and asking whether the series converges by definition meant。

 does the limit of the partial sums converge？ So I have a formula for the partial sums。

 And now I want to ask， well， what about the limit as n goes to infinity of the sequence of partial sums。

 So I want to compute this limit。The only way that n appears here is in this R to the n portion。

 so we have to investigate that Now， imagine R is a number bigger than one， like say two。😡。

In this case，2 to the power of n as n gets large is going to diverge when R is greater than one here。

 the R of the n term is going to blow up。 the whole thing will diverge。 But if r is less than1。

 say number like1 half1 half to the power of something really big， gets really small。

 So that portion goes away in limit。 So the point is depends on the value of R。 Indeed。

 our final way of saying it is that the magnitude of R so taking the absolute value here is greater than1。

 then this is going to diverge， is not going to settle at a value。

 But if the magnitude of R is less than1。 then that whole term。

 the R of the n term is going to go away and I'm just left with an a on the top and a1 minus R on the bottom。

 And then I guess the final case I need to analyzes what happens if it's R equal to1。

 So this is taking the sum of a1 to the power of n。 It's taking an infinite sum of a times1。

 it's a times1， which is just a plus a plus a plus a plus a plus a。😊。

The infinite sum which just take the constant and add it up is clearly going to diverge so indeed I can replace this with not just greater than one but greater than or equal to one that's when it's going to diverge so for the geometric series we know exactly when it convergees and exactly when it diverges。

😡，And then finally， this is just the limit of the partial sums。

 But we said that if the limit of the partial sums converges， then so too does the series。

 That is how we defined convergence of a series。 So then I can say that the summation of this A R to the power of n-1。

 that that diverges for the absolute value of R bigger or equal to one and converges for less than1。

 Let's see this for the examples we began with for the particular series that's adding one half。

 a quarter and8 and so on。 This is just one half to the power of n。 Now。

 this is almost of the format of the geometric series， but notice the indexing here。

 It's not to the power of n1， It's to the power of n here。

 So why don't I just pull out a factor of112。 I'll put that into the constant。

 And now it to the power of n -1。 So I sort of align my formulas here。 my a is12。

 And now I've got to the power of n-1 on my other one2。 Okay， plug in my formula here。

 R is less than。😊，So it's in the convergence case one half is less than one and so I can just plug it into my formula and indeed it equals one So indeed if I want to go one unit away and I go half the distance then a quarter than the 8 and the 6th I add all of those up。

 I will eventually get at least in the limit as these things are going to infinity converging to the value of one to have gone the entire way across this length。

😡，But if it was only one third， it still converges。

 It still converges because the R is less than one。 The one third is less than one。

 But now when I look at it， some， it adds up to one half。 So going 1 third，1，9th，1，27th， and so on。

 I'll never get 100% of the way there。 I'll never get that one unit away。

 I'll only get half of the unit away。 So in this video。

 we have talked about the geometric series as a special case of the idea of convergence of series。

 And indeed， geometric series are very nice there。 One of the few series where not only can we tell whether it converges or diverges。

 but we can say exactly what it converges to。😊。
