# P47ï¼šL47- The Definite Integral Part I - Approximating Areas with rectangles - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

I'm excited because we've been stuck with differentiation for quite a long time in this courseã€‚

 but finallyï¼Œ we get to see in this video the second major tool in calculusï¼Œ which is the integralã€‚

 But what is the integral and why is it helpful and what kind of questions is it going to answerã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So I want to begin with a very geometric questionï¼Œ we have some curveã€‚

 this is the graph of y equal to x squaredã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_6.png)

And I graphed it between zero and one over here and what I'm asking isã€‚

 what is this area under the curveï¼Œ what is this area over hereï¼ŸðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_9.png)

It's not a nice triangleï¼Œ it's not a nice circleï¼Œ it's not a nice rectangleã€‚

 it's not one of the ones that I have a formula forã€‚

 it's a sort of weird curve top and then all this portion down here so how can we figure out what that area isï¼Ÿ

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_12.png)

Now the integral is going to answer many different questionsã€‚

 and this is just one of the sort of foundational ones that we're going to useï¼Œ in factã€‚

 to define the notion of the integralã€‚

What I going to do first to give you a relatively crude approximationã€‚



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_17.png)

I'm going to come here and I'm going to put a bunch of rectangles and my rectangles sort of overlap with my curveã€‚

 you see that what I've done here is I've divided my zero up to one into five different regionsï¼Œ 0ã€‚2ã€‚

4ã€‚6ã€‚8 and1 and I've given a rectangle that has a width down here always of that 0ã€‚

2 so the width is always going to be the 0ã€‚2ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_19.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_20.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_21.png)

But then the height of my rectangleï¼Œ what I do is I go and I make the right pointã€‚

 always line up on the curveã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_23.png)

So this is a bunch of rectangles where their right endpoints are on the curveã€‚

 but they sort of spill out to the left and they've got these even widths of 0ã€‚2ã€‚



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_25.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_26.png)

Soã€‚What if I compute the area of these rectanglesï¼Œ As we can seeï¼Œ it'll be a little bit moreã€‚

 it will be an overestimate to the area under the particular curve of x squaredã€‚

 but it's not completely terribleã€‚ And indeedï¼Œ if I wanted to do it numericallyï¼Œ there is rectangleã€‚

 So I should be able to add them up pretty quicklyã€‚

 I can figure what the area here is notice that the width is the 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ the 0ã€‚

2 all the way along but that the height of them changes in this case where I'm using 0ã€‚2ï¼Œ it go to 0ã€‚

2 squared here is 0ã€‚4 and because it's x squared to go to 0ã€‚4 squared and so onã€‚

 And then I can add all those up and I get apparently it's 0ã€‚44ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_28.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_29.png)

This doesn't seem terrible by the wayï¼Œ if you imagine the triangle that went from zero to11 that point thereã€‚

 that triangle would have area a half and this looks like a little bit less than that triangle so it seems kind of reasonable and then I will again note that what we' have been using is the so-called right endpoints where the heights of my triangles have been specified by the right endpoint of them going up to the level of the functionã€‚

Now this is not the only way that I can do this for instanceã€‚

 if I have this curve and I want to measure the area under it what if instead of using right endpoints I use some slightly different rectangles in this case the rectangles I'm using the left endpoints so this is the rectangle of height0 the rectangle of height 0ã€‚

2 squared of 0ã€‚4 squared 0ã€‚6 squared and so on so again five different rectangles and this time the area of them is going to be a little bit too small and I again can go and figure out what that computation is it's just the 0ã€‚

2 stayed the same but my heights have all changed a little bit and now I've gotten the value of 0ã€‚

24 which was a good ways underneath the 0ã€‚44 that we saw beforeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_31.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_32.png)

So we have these two different approximations for effectively the same thingã€‚

Now can I do any better than this note that here I used five different rectanglesã€‚Wellã€‚

 what if instead of five rectanglesï¼Œ I broke it up into 10 different rectangles into that same basic ideaï¼Ÿ



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_34.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_35.png)

Notice that now I think that the error has gotten in a little bit better that because it's sort of a finer resolutionã€‚

 my rectangles have come closer to approximating the valueã€‚ indeedã€‚

 if we show what we had before hereï¼Œ this was the case with fiveã€‚

 and you notice that there's these big gapsï¼Œ there's a big gap hereï¼Œ hereï¼Œ hereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_37.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_38.png)

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_39.png)

But when I use 10ï¼Œ yeahï¼Œ there's gapsï¼Œ but they've gone definitely a little bit smallerã€‚

So I think the lesson that we can take from this is that when we have a smaller number of rectangles to approximate that we get a bigger error and that when we have a larger number of rectanglesã€‚

 we're going to have a smaller errorï¼Œ so here is the fundamental idea if I allow RN to be a shorthand and RN is going to be standing for the area if I approximate it with n different rectanglesã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_41.png)

Wellï¼Œ in this caseï¼Œ we have 10 different rectanglesï¼Œ so I've approximated with R 10ã€‚

 then the big idea is thisã€‚What if instead of 10 different rectanglesã€‚

 I used 50 or 100 or 100 million different rectanglesã€‚ All of these are possibilitiesã€‚

 And in particularï¼Œ what happens if I let the value of n go to infinityï¼Ÿ

 So the big idea here is that the areaï¼Œ the true areaã€‚

 the actual value of this is equal to this limitã€‚

![](img/ba906ad2c32bb4f3cdc77ecbd2f8404e_43.png)

As N goes to infinity of the rectangles as the number of them is going to infinityã€‚

 that is we are saying that the rectangle approximation with n intervals as you allow the end to get bigger and bigger and biggerã€‚

 your approximation gets better and better and betterã€‚

 these little holes get smaller and smaller and smaller and you approach the area underneath this curveã€‚
