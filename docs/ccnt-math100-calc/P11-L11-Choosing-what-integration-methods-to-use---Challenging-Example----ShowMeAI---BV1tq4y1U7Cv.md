In this videoï¼Œ I want to look at a somewhat complicated endã€‚

 one that is not straightforward and transparently one of the five different methodologies that we saw of the previous videoã€‚

 It's going to turn out that it's going to be a couple of this methodologyologies all sort of combine in oneã€‚

 and I want to describe thought process of how I determine which method to apply in any particular placeã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_2.png)

Firstï¼Œ I'm just going note that the other major methods don't apply immediatelyã€‚

 This is not a quotient of polynomials because of the Ln of xã€‚ So it's not partial fractionsã€‚

 It's not going to be a trig sub because we have1 plus x cubedï¼Œ not one plus x squaredã€‚

 It doesn't have any trig termsã€‚ So it's not going to be some trig identitiesï¼Œ at least not yetã€‚

 But the one thing I can look at the one thing that I can sort of sink my teeth into is that I note that I have this x cubed down here on the bottomã€‚

 and I have this x squared up here on the topã€‚ that I have this relationship of a polynomial of degree N and a polynomial of degree n-1ã€‚

 and this screams out to me that perhaps I should use either U equals1 plus x cubed or u equals x cubedã€‚

 I don't immediately know which of those two I should useã€‚

 But I'm tend towards U equals x cubed simply because if I do the one plus x cubed businessã€‚

 then in myã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_6.png)

L N of Xï¼Œ when I transfer that into useï¼Œ that's gonna be a little bit messierã€‚

 You're gonna have some sort of difference thereã€‚ So let me go and try what happens if I set U equals to X cubedã€‚

 and maybe it's gonna to work outã€‚ Maybe it's notã€‚ We'll have to seeã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_8.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_9.png)

Wellï¼Œ if I do thatï¼Œ then duu is equal to3 x squared dxã€‚

 and I might also rearrange the top to say that x is equal to u to the power of1 thirdã€‚

 This is going to be particular useful for the Ln of xï¼Œ which will now be Ln of u to the power of13ã€‚

So let's transfer into useã€‚First of allï¼Œ I have an x squared dX on the top that's going to be now one3ã€‚

 so I'll put the one third out the frontï¼Œ one third Dï¼Œ and I'll leave the DU off to the rightã€‚

Then I have an Ln of xï¼Œ but now the Ln of x transforms to an Ln of u to the power of 1 thirdã€‚

 all divided by 1 plus uã€‚Squaretã€‚All rightã€‚This is getting a little bit betterã€‚

 And maybe you'll do one other just a little piece of algebra hereã€‚

 which is to note that if I have some log rulesï¼Œ I've got this U to the one thirdã€‚

 the one third can come out the front because Ln of x to the a is equal to a Ln of xã€‚

 So in other wordsï¼Œ this is gonna to be a9 feltt the frontã€‚

 the integral of Ln of U divided by1 plus U squared D Uã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_11.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_12.png)

Nowï¼Œ this LN of viewï¼Œ the natural log of view is one of these things that keeps on and consistently screwing things up for me because againã€‚

 I can't just straightforwardly apply a method like for instancechã€‚

 partial fractions because of its existenceã€‚And generally LN ofï¼Œ if I'm able to integrate itã€‚

 it's a bit of a messï¼Œ but differentiating LN of U is actually quite niceï¼Œ It's just one over Uã€‚

 So maybe I wanted to do thatï¼Œ maybe want to find some way that I can differentiate LN of and to do that I want to do integration by parts where I'm going to let my U to be LN of U or I new U to be LN of and DV to be this other business that I have around the one plus u squaredã€‚

 the one over one plus U squaredã€‚ All rightã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_14.png)

I'm going to do integration by parts hereï¼Œ I'm going to allow V to be equal to LN of Vã€‚

 and then I'm going to give a new symbol hereã€‚ W Dw is going to be equal to D over1 plus U squared and I'm using V and W here instead of U and V just because' is already been taken up so I want to have new variables so I'm using V and W for my integration by partsã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_16.png)

All rightï¼Œ so V isã€‚The natural log of youï¼Œ then DV is going to be equal to one over U Do Uã€‚

And if Dw is D U over1 plus U squaredï¼Œ then my W is going to be equal to1 plus U to the  -1ã€‚

 taking that derivative would introduce another minus signã€‚

 So I need to put a-1 plus 1 plus U to the power of -1ã€‚ All rightã€‚

 So let's see how this becomes in the integration by parts formulaã€‚The one knifeã€‚

It sticks out the front Now I want to do v times Wã€‚

 so this is going to be Ln of U multiplied by negative 1 plus u to the minus1ã€‚Musã€‚

I'm going to have a negative in hereï¼Œ so I'm going to put a plus two negatives makes a plus the integralã€‚

 Now I want to do W DVã€‚ So this is going to be minus1 overï¼Œ I've got a U hereã€‚

 and I've also got a1 plus U Dã€‚

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_18.png)

So this was me doing my integration by partsã€‚ And now I've gotten rid of the natural log of U that was sort of tripping things upã€‚

 So I first cleaned it up with a substitutionã€‚ that got it rid of some of the extra powers of xã€‚

 Then I need an integration by parts to deal with the L N of x that I didn't wantã€‚

 But now what I have this business that remains over here is wellã€‚

1 on the top and a polynomial on the bottomã€‚ So it a rational functionã€‚

 and therefore integration by partial fractions is going to apply to thisã€‚

 So what I want to do is therefore take the integra hereã€‚

 and apply the method of partial fractions to itã€‚ I have a1 divided by u times a1 plus u My standard guessã€‚

 This is a product of linear factors is going to be a divided by u plus B divided by1 plus uã€‚

 multiplying by the denominatorã€‚ This is going to give me1 is equal to a times1ã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_20.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_21.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_22.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_23.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_24.png)

plus b times uã€‚And I need to solve for A and B nowï¼Œ so I'm going to set U equal to zeroã€‚

 that is going to imply that one is just equal to aã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And U equals to minus1 is going to imply that1 is equal to B times minus1ï¼Œ so B is equal to minus1ã€‚

In other wordsï¼Œ if I'm going to take this little bit that I have hereã€‚

 I can now figure out what this interval is going to beã€‚

 So this algebra is going to allow me to replace the integral of1 over u times 1 plus U D Uã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_26.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_27.png)

Withã€‚The integral of one divided by u minus one divided by one plus uã€‚Do youï¼Ÿ

And this is going to be Ellen of youï¼Œ minusã€‚Lï¼Œ N of one plus you all plus Cã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_29.png)

So putting all of this togetherï¼Œ I am therefore going to get copying and pasting mostlyã€‚

One divided by9ã€‚Ln of U multiply by 1 plus u to the -1ã€‚

 And then I have a minus sign in front of all the side computation I didã€‚

 So it is going to be minus the natural log of absolute value of U plus the natural log of absolute value 1 plus Uã€‚

All finallyï¼Œ plus some constant Cã€‚And I'm not quite done yet because I've written my final answer all in terms of Uã€‚

 but we had made a U sub all the way back at the beginningã€‚

 We had denoted that U was just going to be equal to x cubedã€‚ So in my final answer down hereã€‚

 I need to come and substitute all of my U's for X cubedã€‚ So this is going to be one9thã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_31.png)

![](img/866e478d22ce4fbc405ab0d43b5ea7eb_32.png)

The natural log of x cubedã€‚us1 plus x cubed -1ã€‚Minus the natural log of x cubedã€‚Plusã€‚

 the natural log of one plus x cubedã€‚ Finally plus Cã€‚ So at the end of the dayã€‚

 this method really had three different parts to itã€‚ Firstï¼Œ we did a U sub to get rid of the X cubesã€‚

 Then we did an integration by parts to sort of clean up the natural log of xã€‚ and finallyã€‚

 we finished it off with an integration by partial fractionsã€‚

 And it's worth noting that I didn't know we were going to get to a partial fractions at the end of this exampleã€‚

 It happens to work out that wayï¼Œ or at least I wouldn't know if I'd seen this problem for the first timeã€‚

 So part of this is coming up with an initial strategyï¼Œ your initial substitutionsã€‚

 And then you sort of follow your nose and you apply methods as they reveal themselves further along in the computationã€‚
