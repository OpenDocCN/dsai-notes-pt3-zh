Today's integration method is called partial fractions。

 And partial fractions is really just a little bit of algebra。 In fact， it's undoing some algebra。

 you've almost certainly seen before。 the idea of a lowest common denominator。 The idea is this。

 Suppose I start with an expression like that。 One of the things that you can do to this is apply a lowest common denominator。

 where you do sort of cross multiplying And what you get is a single multiplication of terms in the denominator。

 And then these two linear terms。 The X -1 and the x plus 2。

 They should get cross multiplied out of the top。😊，And if you want to。

 you can then take that and you can expand it out and you can get x plus 5 on the top and a polynomial on the bottom Now imagine to integrate this。

 actually let me integrate all three of these， which of these would be easier to integrate。😡。

I don't actually know right off the top of my head how to integrate this bottom one here。

 setting the U to be a denominator and a U sub the D U doesn't match the numerator。

 Maybe I could think of a way to do it， but it would be a bit challenging。 However。

 the top one is something I can do。 For example， if I focus on the left hand side by set u equal to x -1。

 then this is just going to be twice the logarithm of the absolute value of x -1 after a little U substitution for x plus 2 is my U。

 Then I'm going to get minus logarithm of x plus 2。 and then finally plus C。

So the whole point is that this bottom one is hard to do。

 but the top one is actually straightforward。 So then if I was given an integral that looked like the bottom here。

 one of these challenging ones， then what I wanted to do is try to do this process where I undo a lowest common denominator track and that's going to turn it into this top form that I do know how to do So how in general do we undo finding lowest common denominators Let's actually do it in a harder example to illustrate the point In this particular example I've got some quadratic on the top and a cubic on the bottom。

Now， because I'm doing lowest common denominators I actually don't really care what the numerator is。

 maybe I could try to factor and it looks like it would be a bit messy in this case。

 but whatever it's the denominator I want to factor。

I notice that it's a cubic and that there's an x in every term。

 so the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to factor out an x。

 and then that quadratic in the denominator， I can factor that out。

 it's going to give me a 2 x minus1 and an x plus 2 and then al multiplied by the x。😡，Now。

 this is what I want to focus on。 I want to undo a lowest common denominator like this。

 That is to say， I want to find three other numbers。 I want to find this A， B and C。

 and I want to write it in this right hand way So that the thing I began with is the result of taking the lowest common denominator to the right hand side。

 So how can I do this。 Well， if I was taking the lowest common denominator。

 what I would do is I would multiply both sides by the denominator on the left hand side taking the denominator and multiply and it just gets rid of it。

But on the right hand side， it's a little bit more complicated。

 I'm going to step away for a moment here because there's going to be a lot of algebra on the screen。

 but the basic idea is that for the A over x term， when I multiply by the denominator， the x cancels。

 and I'm left with a multiplication of 2 x minus1 and x plus2 for the B term。

 the 2 x minus1 goes away when I'm multiply by the denominator left with an x and an x plus 2 and for this C term。

 it's x and 2 x minus1。Now I'm going to clean it up a little bit。

 I've got an A times something and a B times something and a C times something。

 and I'm going to expand all three of those。 so the left hand side remains the same becomes a times a quadratic。

 B times a quadratic and C times a quadratic。Now， I've been focusing on the A， the B and the C。

 but I want to now focus on the x squared， the quadratic terms， the x terms。

 the so the linear ones and the constant terms。 That is I'm just going rearrange the righthand side。

 But I'm going to rearrange it in terms of powers of x。

 So there's x squared and then all the things that multipied by the x squared looks like a 2 a and a B and a 2 C。

 then I'm going to add all the things that multiply out by the x term， the linear term。

 and then finally I leave whatever constant remains it looks like a minus 2 a。

 So this isn't any calculus。 it's just algebra just reordering it's expanding everything out。

 seeing what the values are multiplied by x squared x and constant respectively and then factoring them in terms of the x squared in terms of the x。

 and in terms of the constant term。 Allright so let me keep my focus on that。 Allright， once again。

 there's space for me now。😊，If I look at this equation， I see one equation on its face， but in truth。

 there's three different equations here。 and the idea is that this quadratic， the x squared terms。

 the linear of the x terms and the constant terms， they sort of very independently。 Like for example。

 if P plug in x equal to  zero here， all that would remain is the constant terms。

 So that would mean that the constant terms all had to be equal。

 There's an equation for those And then as I vary the x or I varied the x squared。

 the coefficients of the x would have to line up the coefficients of the x squared would have to light up。

 So it can split this into these three different equations。

 One equation which is relating the coefficients of x squared。

 one equation that's relating the coefficients of x and one equation that's relating the constant terms。

 And then in fact， I can actually just get rid of the x and the x squared here to have three different equations。

 and if I get rid of the original， this is the system of equations I want to solve。

 There are three equations， and there are three unknown variables， the a the B and the C now。😊。

How do you solve systems of equations like this Actually I'm going to teach a course I believe in the summer an online linear algebra course one of the things it will do is show a systematic way where you can solve systems of linear equations like this always plug you should register for it in the summer however for our purpose I would just encourage you to pause and just sort of ad hoc try to solve it see whether you can get the A B and C from this linear system of equations I'll do it relatively quickly for you when I look here I look at the third equation this third equation is very simple it basically just tells me what my A is so my A is one half I can then plug the value of one half into the spots where there was going be the A and the two different equations。

If then look at the top equation。 Okay， I'm going to put the constant back together。

 So0 is equal to b plus 2 C。 And this is gonna to give me a relationship that B is minus2 times C。

 Allright， so that was manipulating the top equation。 If I now focus in on the second equation here。

 I have a B and a C。 But from the top equation， I have this relationship。 But where there's a B here。

 I can plug in minus2 c。 So let me do that Ill replace my b with minus2 C。

 And now the second equation is all in terms of c value。 So if I collect the C。

 then collect the coefficients I get one half is minus5 c and if I go and divide out。

 I get my C is minus110。😊，So now I know my A and know my C， if I look at the top equation again。

 remember had that relationship B is minus twice C。 So if C is minus110。

 then my b is gonna be equal to1 fifthth。 and now I have my A Bcs。

 So that was my particular sort of ad hoc way of solving the system a linear equation is just just a bunch of algebra。

 All right， where are we we solve the ABcs。 and I'll remind you that the ABcs were the ABcs in this form。

 A over x B over2 x minus1 and C over x plus2。 I was trying to figure out what the ABcs are。

 I now know what they are， so I can go and plug them in。 And finally。

 I am trying to integrate something。 So what do I want to do。

 I want to go and replace this with something that I am integrating。

 I am integrating the one half over x。 I am integrating the onefith over 2 x minus-1 and so on。😊。

Each of these is gonna to be a logarithm， a logarithm with a different use substitution。

 So what do I get one half logarithm of x that I get one1th， the one fifth。

 and then there's another one half that comes when I do my use substution with u 2 x minus1 So11th。

 this logarithm of2 x minus1 and absolute values and then minus the 110th the logarithm of x plus2 all plus C。

 So indeed I have gone from that original rational function， the polynolu or polynomial。

 I split it up using this partial fractions algebra， I figured out my coefficients by ABc。

 and when I did that， I got something I could integrate。

 now I've got in the function after I integrate Now the method that we've talked about。

 it does work generally， but there's a couple different cases and we've only seen one of them in this video that is if I'm looking at a socalled rational function。

 a quotient of polynomial， a P of x over over Q of x I'm asking is that Q of x， the denominator。

 can I write that as a multiplication。😊，A bunch of non repeating linear factors that's what we had before we saw it was like an x and then at 2 x minus1 and an x plus two。

 it was a bunch of linear factors all multiplied out and none of them repeated。

And if that is the case。 then the algebra you want to try to do makes it look like a bunch of constants an A1 over the first linear term plus an A2 over the second linear term and so on。

 However， we're not done yet because we haven't exhausted all the cases。 So in the next video。

 what are we going talk about， we're gonna talk about what if some of those linear terms were repeated。

 Like instead of a division by X， it was division by x squared， which is like a linear term twice。

 or what if there was a quadratic term， a term like x squared plus1。

 one where you tried to do the quadratic formula， you get imaginary numbers。

 you couldn't split it up into linear factors very easily。

 that will be the subject of the next video。
