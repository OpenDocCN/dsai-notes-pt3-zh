# P50ï¼šL50- 'Reverse' Riemann Sums _ Finding the Definite Integral Given a Sum - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ I want to talk about a particular type of problem involving Rman integrationã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_1.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_2.png)

So what I've rooting down here is the definition of the integral via Free sumsï¼Œ in other wordsã€‚

 I'm saying the integral from a up to B of some function f of x dxã€‚

 that this is defined to be this limit of the sum of f of x I' delta xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_4.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_5.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_6.png)

Now this formulaï¼Œ which is one that you need to understandï¼Œ and youll recall in our previous videosã€‚

 we have this nice geometric derivation of thisã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒBut what I want you to be able to do is actually apply in specific problemsã€‚

 and it can work one of two waysã€‚ I could give you the function and ask you to write down the sum or the so called reverse problemã€‚

 I could give you this sum and perhaps the interval A B as wellï¼Œ and ask youï¼Œ what is the functionã€‚

 which this particular sum isï¼Œ say the right endpoint remain approximation ofã€‚

 So that reverse problem that going from the sum to the function that I want to investigate in this videoã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_8.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_9.png)

Nowï¼Œ first of allï¼Œ two little things that we want to look at this definition hereã€‚

 which absolutely you need to knowï¼Œ there also need to figure out how to compute the X's and how to compute the delta x'sã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_11.png)

So there's two formulas that are relevant hereã€‚ And I'm going to do the Delta X firstï¼Œ the deelta Xã€‚

 This is equal to the B minus a divided out by the nã€‚ And the X I hereï¼Œ this is given byã€‚

Xi is equal to whatever the starting point a isã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_13.png)

And then you go over one deelta x 2 deelta xï¼Œ3 deelta x as you iterate along the Ri sumã€‚

 So in other wordsï¼Œ it is a plus sum number I times deelta Xï¼Œ or if I prefer a plus Iã€‚

 B minus a all divided out by nã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_15.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_16.png)

This formulaï¼Œ which we've defined for the definition of everyone integrationã€‚

 that you should be able to take this sort of Xi and plug it in hereã€‚

 and that you should be able to take this deelta X and plug it in thereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_18.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_19.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_20.png)

By the wayï¼Œ this worked for XI denoting right endpoint approximationsã€‚

 this is a very small change that you can think about if we wanted to denote left endpoint approximationsã€‚

 but the standard way to access is problems with right endpoint approximationsã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_22.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_23.png)

So what I've written down here is I've got a limit is N goes to inferityã€‚

 I have a sum of I equal to 1 to nã€‚ that doesn't really changeã€‚

 And then I have the tangent of 2 plus 3 I times3 over nã€‚

 and I'm claiming that I'm using right endpointsã€‚ And I have to tell you one more thingã€‚

 I'm using right endpointsã€‚ I have to tell you what the interval isã€‚

 I have to tell you where I am doing thisã€‚ So I am going to claim that my right endpoints are going to be usedã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_25.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_26.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_27.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_28.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_29.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_30.png)

On a specific intervalï¼Œ and I'm going to do how about0ï¼Œ3ã€‚

 I think that's going to make everything look niceã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_32.png)

So here's how you want you to do itã€‚ Remember a formula for deelta Xï¼Œ a formula for X Iã€‚

 let's go in and plug in those values given this interval that we haveã€‚

 So the way this works is that we're going to say that my deelta x well what was that that was B minus a over n So3 minus0 divided by n or in other wordsã€‚

3 over nã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_34.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_35.png)

And we can note right off the bat that I have a three divided by n in my formula that this part sure looks like it's going to be Delta Xã€‚

Okayï¼Œ wellï¼Œ that was certainly interestingã€‚ Nowï¼Œ let's continueã€‚

 I can also figure out what my X I isã€‚ Wellï¼Œ X I was aï¼Œ in this caseï¼Œ a is 0ã€‚ So0ã€‚

 that's my a right thereï¼Œ0 plus some number of I' times the deelta xã€‚ So I 3 over nã€‚

 or other words I 3 divided out by nã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_37.png)

And then againï¼Œ we can go back to our formula that we have up here and we notice that this partã€‚

 that sure looks exactly like thatï¼Œ this is going to be equal to the Xiã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_39.png)

Notice itï¼Œ keep them separateï¼Œ they're pretty similarã€‚

 but the Xi has the expression that has the eye in itï¼Œ the det a doesn't have any eyesã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_41.png)

All rightï¼Œ so now let's try to write down the definite integral that corresponds to this particular Riman sumã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_43.png)

So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to do theã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_45.png)

Intervalï¼Œ and I'm going between0 and 3ã€‚ And the reason why is because I specified that we were going between 0 and 3 in my actual questionã€‚

 If you didn't specify thatï¼Œ by the wayï¼Œ there'd be different integrals that you could sort of shift them to the left or the rightã€‚

 But if I give you an intervalï¼Œ I'm telling you the0 to3ã€‚ So that's the first pointã€‚ Second pointã€‚

 I'm gonna have some f of x Dx hereã€‚ but let's do the Dx firstã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_47.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_48.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_49.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_50.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_51.png)

Dx in the integral sort of the infiniteable version of the delta Xã€‚

 So if this3 over n that we had at the top was this delta xã€‚

 eventually it's going to go away and what we're going to be left with is that that whole thingã€‚

 the3 over n that was the delta Xï¼Œ it's just going to go into this symbol DXã€‚ All rightï¼Œ wonderfulã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_53.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_54.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_55.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_56.png)

Second thing that changes is that anywhere you've got an Xi in your sumã€‚

 the Xi is going to transform just into Xï¼Œ so I'm going to have this tangent of 2 plus xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_58.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_59.png)

So the way I write this is I just say this is the tangentã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Of two plus and then I'll change to the colors that we can identify it2 plus this variable X and all of that multiplied by dxã€‚

 In other wordsï¼Œ when going from the Riman sum into this definite integral that we've write downã€‚

 That's our final answer hereã€‚ It was all about figuring out what was the delta X that was going to go into the Dxã€‚

 what was the X that was going to turn into an Xï¼Œ and then everything remain that was going to go into the functionã€‚

 the tangent and the2 plus that was going to go into the function of the X I turned into the X and the delta X part turned into the Dxã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_61.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_62.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_63.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_64.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_65.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_66.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_67.png)

Okayï¼Œ so that was a fairly straightforward exampleã€‚

 let us see one more slightly more complicated exampleã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_69.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_70.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_71.png)

All rightï¼Œ so I have this second example hereã€‚ it looks like a much messier summa doesn't obviously a look of the form f of Xi times deelta xã€‚

 but it is the same interval zero to 3ã€‚ So the delta X and the X are exactly the same so let's write them downã€‚

So now what I have to do is I have to sort of unravel the messy no of this particular summation and try to see a delta X and try to see an X in thereã€‚

 even though it's messyã€‚So the first thing I'm going to focus onã€‚

 I noticed that I actually occurs in two places in the sunã€‚

 but I think the closest looking one is this guy right hereï¼Œ the six eye over inã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_73.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_74.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_75.png)

Because six I overran and three I overran they're pretty close indeed this looks like twice X and that's all right because if I was translating this into a functionã€‚

 this would turn into2 x so that portion of it I likeã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_77.png)

Now here's the tricky thingã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_79.png)

I've got this remaining eyeï¼Œ which is sticking out here on the right hand sideï¼Œ like a sore thumbã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_81.png)

And then when I'm atï¼Œ I've got this weird eyeï¼Œ but I alsoã€‚

 I don't have another three over and anywhereï¼Œ I don't have an obvious delta Xã€‚

 So what on earth is going onã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_83.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_84.png)

Nowï¼Œ what I think I'm going to do is that if I look at the formulaã€‚

 the X I is equal to I3 over and lookï¼Œ I just have this I by itselfã€‚

 So why don't I try and identify what I is supposed to be hereï¼Œ Okayï¼Œ so I is going to be equal toã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Xi divided out by3 and multiplied by nã€‚So that's a formula and I can take this and I could substitute it in so why don't I try thatã€‚

 let's see what happens if I'm going to go and write out thisã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_86.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_87.png)

Okayï¼Œ so now as I've written it downï¼Œ I've made those two changes that6i over inã€‚

 I replaced that with a  twoxi and the I on the bottomã€‚

 I replaced that with this Xi times n all divided up by threeã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_89.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_90.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_91.png)

Okayï¼Œ so making a little bit of progressã€‚ Nowï¼Œ next pointã€‚

 I still have to figure out where is my deelta Xï¼Œ My delta x is3 over nã€‚

 But but look what's happened in transforming this Iï¼Œ I now can see it if I take that3 and that nã€‚

 this is going to be my Delta Xã€‚ So I'm making a lot of progress hereã€‚ Nowã€‚

 what I have is I have a bunch of different x sizeã€‚ And I also have a deelta xã€‚

 So I think I can take this nowï¼Œ and I can go and try to write out what my definite integral is going to beã€‚

 I'm gonna say that this is equal to the integralã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_93.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_94.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_95.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_96.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_97.png)

From A up to Bï¼Œ so a was zero all the way up to threeã€‚I know what's happening to the Delta xã€‚

 the deelta x is going over and is transforming into just a Dxã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_99.png)

And then I know that the X eyes's turn into X's and everything else that remains goes into my functionã€‚

 So the X's are going to x'sï¼Œ everything else is just going into my original functionã€‚

 So what does this look like lookss like I got a9 up here on the topã€‚

 Nothing ever happened to that It would just sort of being there annoyingã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_101.png)

![](img/4fc76f362102d00d3ccfefa344c1d89a_102.png)

I've got a2 and I'm going to even take the first two over here and leave it thereï¼Œ2 plus two squaredã€‚

 and then I'm going to put in my X Is turning to x I've got1 x there and I've got an x down here on the bottom and so there we have it we have now the definite integral corresponding to the right rhmon approximation on the interval 03 of this particular limit of a sum of sum messy expressionã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
