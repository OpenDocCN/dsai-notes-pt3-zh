# P6ï¼šL6- Limit Laws _ Breaking Up Complicated Limits Into Simpler Ones - ShowMeAI - BV1544y1C7pC

In this videoï¼Œ we're going to try to develop a bunch of limit lawsã€‚

 different rules that are going to make it easier us for us to compute more complicated limits by breaking them down into easier limits So for exampleã€‚

 suppose that what you had was the sum of two different functions like B to the x plus x cubed and then you wanted to figure out what the limit was as x went to some particular valueã€‚

 Can you do something about that can you use the fact that this is a sum to help you in some wayã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So I'm going give you an example of a few different functionsã€‚

 so what I have here is a function F of x that goes up here and goes flatã€‚

 I've got a G of x goes longï¼Œ goes down and then what I've sketched up here is the function F of x plus G of xã€‚

 it's a new functionï¼Œ but it's a function that's built out of these other two onesã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_10.png)

And you'll notice for exampleï¼Œ that if I take the value of f at 0 which is 0 plus 2ï¼Œ0 plus 2 is2ã€‚

 so the start of f of x or here looks like this is height of 1 and then we've got a height of2 and then we've got a height of3 which is1 plus2 so indeed everything seems to work out relatively nicely that is indeed the graph of f of x plus g of xã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_13.png)

Now I'm going to focus just for fun at what the limit was if I chose the A equal to a halfã€‚

 so I'm going to go and look up here all the halfsã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_15.png)

So if I was just going to do everVXï¼Œ then I could come around here and I've got this one point there and the limit of everVx at the value of a half is just going to be equal to this 0ã€‚

5ã€‚So I'm going to say the limitã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_17.png)

As x goes to 0ã€‚5 of F of xã€‚This is equal to looks like a 0ã€‚5ã€‚All rightï¼Œ lovelyã€‚Okayã€‚

 so now let me do the same storyï¼Œ but I want to look at it for the G of x hereã€‚ So a G of Xã€‚

 it looks like it's got this height up here of  twoã€‚ So I'm going to say that the limitã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_19.png)

As my x goes to 0ã€‚5ï¼Œ but not of my F now now of my G of xã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_21.png)

That this is going to be equal to twoã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_23.png)

That is that the limitã€‚As x goes to 0ã€‚5 of now my F of x plus my G of xã€‚

 the sum of those two functionsã€‚ThatWhat it appears to be is equal to the 2ã€‚5ã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_25.png)

Now what I want you to observe is that a half plus2 is equal to 2ã€‚

5 In other words it looks like that the limit of a sum is just the sum of the two limitsã€‚

 so indeed this is the formula that we haveï¼Œ the limit of the sum of two things is the sum of two different limit added up that I can sort of take this the single limit and distribute it over this particular summation signã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_27.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_28.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_29.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_30.png)

Or at least that's what it appears to beã€‚ Is this formula always trueã€‚ Wellã€‚

 let me show you a specific exampleã€‚ Allrightï¼Œ let's do the limitã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_32.png)

As x goes to the value of I'm going to do the sum of two functionsã€‚

 it's going to be the function one over xã€‚And the function minus1 divided out by Xã€‚

Which1 over x plus minus1 over x is just a different way of saying that this is just going to be equal to zero because indeed they cancelã€‚

So then the question isï¼Œ is this the case that I can say that this is equal to these two individual thingsã€‚

 the limit as x goes to0 of1 over x plus the limit as x goes to zero of minus1 over xã€‚

 is it the case that this is true that this thing on the right hand side is equal to zeroï¼Ÿ



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_34.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_35.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_36.png)

Howeverï¼Œ the problem is that neither of these two limits actually existã€‚



![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_38.png)

Indeedï¼Œ the graph of one over x is something that looks a little bit like thisã€‚

And then minus sign is going to flip it for the otherã€‚

 This is something where the limit has this vertical asymptote at this particular point of x equal to  zeroã€‚

 so this does not existã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_40.png)

And this other limit does not existã€‚So this whole formula is actually kind of nonsense in this scenario because this doesn't existã€‚

 doesn't equal any numberï¼Œ this doesn't existï¼Œ it doesn't equal any numberã€‚

 yet we're saying that they add up together to be equal to the zeroã€‚

So what's the problem with my exampleï¼Œ because I like my formulaã€‚

 we were well motivated by it in the previous exampleï¼Œ but for this exampleã€‚

 it appears to be nonsenseã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd what is needed is an extra qualification This is true if we have the property that both the limit of F of x and the limit of G of x individually existã€‚

 and that was the problem hereï¼Œ these individual ones did not exist and so you sort of got this nonsense formulaã€‚

 but if you add this propertyï¼Œ then we get this true statementã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So this is one of these so-cal limit lawsï¼Œ a law that allows us to break up a more complicated limit into a simpler oneã€‚

 but there are manyã€‚ so for exampleï¼Œ if you have some constants and just real number like sevenã€‚

 the limit of seven times F of x you just seven times whatever the limit was of F of xã€‚

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_43.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_44.png)

![](img/59f2bf28883bbc37fd4b29c942fe25b0_45.png)

Or we have this so-called addivity rule hereï¼Œ but we can do the same thing with productsã€‚

 we could say that the limit of a product is the product of two different limits hereã€‚

 again under this initial assumption that all these individual limits existã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

The same thing with quots I've got to check for nonzero hereï¼Œ but if I have an f of x over a G of xã€‚

 this is the limit of a quotientï¼Œ it is the quotient of a limit provided we have this additional assumption that the one on the bottom the limit of the G of x is nonzero so these add up to be a bunch not all but a bunch of the different limit laws that allow us to break up more complicated limitsã€‚
