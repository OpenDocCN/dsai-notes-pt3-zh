In today's videoï¼Œ I'm going to go through an entire calculus testã€‚

 This is test number 3 in the main sequence here at the University of Cincinnatiã€‚ Nowã€‚

 the idea for youï¼Œ I thinkï¼Œ should not be just to sit and watch meã€‚

 just do this entire test that is meant and take students an hourã€‚

 What I think the idea is is to try the test on your ownã€‚

 I'm going to leave a copy of the test available so you can do itã€‚

 Try the test on your own and then come to the video and jump around to find the specific questions that you want to verify your answers onã€‚

 All rightï¼Œ first problemã€‚ What we've been given here is some derivative some F primeã€‚

 which is 3 d the X plus to sign of Xã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And then we also have this little piece of information that F of 0 is3ã€‚

 and what we are being asked for is to figure out what F of pi isã€‚ So that isï¼Œ I have the derivativeã€‚

 and I want to come up with an anti derivativeã€‚ But a specific oneã€‚ I want the constant to be fixedã€‚

 So this F of 0 is3ï¼Œ and then I can figure out what f of pi isã€‚

 So let's go and try to figure out what the anti derivative is firstã€‚

 So I can take the integral of the F primeã€‚ So of the 3 E V x plus 2 sine of xã€‚And all of that DXã€‚

And this is an integral that I can more or less doã€‚ So 3 e to the xã€‚

 this anti derivative is just 3 E to the xã€‚A sine of x is going to go to a minus cosineã€‚

 So minus twice the two comes along for the rideã€‚ cosine of xã€‚ And then this is importantã€‚

 You have to put in a final plus Cã€‚ I am doing an indefinite integral at this pointã€‚ I get a plus Cã€‚

 Nowï¼Œ what is that C valueã€‚ Wellï¼Œ this is how I can use that F of 0 is equal to three businessã€‚

 because what I can say that if this in is generically equal to the function F of xã€‚

Then if I want to go and figure out what f of0 is going to beã€‚

 while this is three times e to the zero and e to the zero is just oneï¼Œ so three times 1ã€‚

And then cosine of 0 was also oneã€‚ so minus-2 times 1ï¼Œ so minus2ã€‚

And then that gives me my specific value that C is equal to 2ã€‚

So now if I want to figure out what my generic function is going to beã€‚

 my f of x for all values is 3 e to the x minus2 cosine of x as we've had beforeã€‚

 but now I know what the plus C isï¼Œ I can write plus2 final thing I need to figure out what F of pi is going to beã€‚

 So I just plug pi into hereã€‚ So F of pi isï¼Œ wellï¼Œ3 E to the piã€‚ that's kind of a funny oneã€‚

Then cosine of pi is minus-1ã€‚ I already have a minus sign out thereï¼Œ so the minus becomes a plus nowã€‚

 so plus2 times 1ï¼Œ and then plus 2ã€‚ So it looks like3 e to the pi plus 4ã€‚

 Do I have one of those that looks like option Dã€‚ next problemã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_9.png)

This problem is a net change problemï¼Œ it says water flows simultaneously into a tank at a particular flow rateã€‚

 1 plus 4 T cubeï¼Œ and it flows out of a tank at a different flow rate in this case 3 t squared both in liters per minuteã€‚

 and the question is what is the net change during the first two minutesï¼ŸSo in other wordsã€‚

 I am doing a defite interval from zero up to twoï¼Œ this represents the first two minutesã€‚

And I can put both the inflow and the outflow into the same integragramã€‚

 I can say this is going to be the  one plus 4 Tqã€‚ that's the inflow amountã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then you are subtracting off the 3 T squared that is the outflowing amountã€‚

 so inflow minus outflow is the total net flowã€‚Then all of this integrated Dtã€‚ All rightã€‚

 so let's do thisã€‚ Okayï¼Œ so one is going to have an integrated2ã€‚

4 T cubed is going to be plus t to the power of fourã€‚

And then minus T cubed and it looks like everything we sort of bested to work out very niceã€‚

 They drove a T cube to 3 T squareã€‚ you can always go back and check theseã€‚

 and then I'm evaluating it0 and2ã€‚Firstï¼Œ I need to plug in2ã€‚ So2 plus2 to the fourth minus2 cubedã€‚

 that's evaluating it 2ã€‚ And then I need to subtract off evaluating at 0ã€‚

 This is going to be easy 0 plus 0 minus0ã€‚And then final thing okayï¼Œ so two to the power of four is2ã€‚

4816ï¼Œ then I'm going to be subtracting off8ï¼Œ which is 8 plus2ï¼Œ10ã€‚ it looks like I've got 10ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Very nice And this is indeed in leaders because the in is in lit per minute I integrate out time I get two leaders So I have sort of a unit analysis check I would always recommend that you when you find your anti derivative here that you take a derivative and verify is what you have in the inã€‚

You plug in your valuesã€‚ All rightï¼Œ next upã€‚ Nowï¼Œ this problem says that I have a particular limit of a sum of some stuffã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_11.png)

And then this is going to be equal to using a right riman sum so right endpoint on the intervals 0 to twoã€‚

 it's equal to one of these definite integralsï¼Œ but which oneã€‚

So there's a couple of formulas that are reported to remember hereã€‚

 the first is that delta x is generically b minus a all divided o by nã€‚

 and in this particular case here when you're B in your a or2 and 0ã€‚

 this is going to be a width of two divided by nã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And I notice that when I look actually in this inteã€‚

 I see that I've got a two divided by N there and that I see that I've got a two divided by N right thereã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThe other little formula I need to know is wellï¼Œ what about the X eyes if I'm using right endpoints Wellã€‚

 the general is that you start on the far left and then you go over one delta x2 delta x3 delta x generically I delta xã€‚

 So the formula to remember is that you start a and you go over plus I delta Xã€‚

 if you forget these formulas by the wayï¼Œ I always like to come along and have a little picture in my mind hereã€‚

 So if there's my a and there's my B and I think about dividing this up into a bunch of rectanglesã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ the width of one of those rectangles is delta x and then something like that that x1 there is the coordinate of a plus1 copy of delta x and x2 would be a plus two copies of delta x and so on sort of down the lineã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_13.png)

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_14.png)

So by the wayï¼Œ I've got my Xiï¼Œ and in this specific exampleï¼Œ the a is0ï¼Œ the delta x is2 over nã€‚

 so a plus I2 over nã€‚So look at the formulaï¼Œ I've got that deelta x there and actually2 I overranã€‚

 that's exactly my Xiï¼Œ so there's my X Iã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_16.png)

So then I just have to find an indefinite ordefinite rather that kind of looks like thisï¼Œ So0 to twoã€‚

 okay they're all that that's sort of comes for freeã€‚ The two over n is going to goã€‚

 which is our deltaex I' going to come the Dxã€‚ I don't want any sort of two over n type things remainingã€‚

 but I do want to log and I want a1 plus xï¼Œ So log 1 plus x looks like the value of C The X that portion comes into be the X I and the Dx becomes the delta Xã€‚

Wonderfulã€‚This problem is a problem about law rulesã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒI see that I've got a one to twoã€‚

 an eight to oneï¼Œ a two to eightã€‚But there's this rule called addivity of the domainã€‚

And what it says is that in generalï¼Œ if I take the integral from one all the way up to8 of F of X dxã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒI can break up this domain into being the integral from one up to twoã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Of F of xbx and the integral from2 up to8ã€‚Of F of X D Xã€‚ So this is the property addivity of domainã€‚

 And the basic idea of addivity of domain is that a larger region can be written as a sum of some smaller regionsã€‚

 and you just add them upï¼Œ and that gives you the total area of the larger regionã€‚ Nowã€‚

 what am I actually trying to solve forã€‚ I am trying to solve for 2 to 8ã€‚

 But notice there's a sneaky2 thereã€‚ I'm actually asking twice F of xã€‚

 But but let me figure it out for F of x firstã€‚ And then I'll just multiply by 2ã€‚

 the two that I have hereã€‚ It can come out the front If I so wishã€‚

 So I'm going to figure out this right hand2 to 8 of F of X Dxã€‚

 Then I'm going come back and figure out what twice that is by multiping by 2ã€‚Now one to eightã€‚

 the only problem is I don't have one to eightï¼Œ I have eight to oneã€‚So if 8 to 1 is -7ã€‚

 then 1 to 8 is going to be 7ã€‚ So this left guy over here is going to be 7ã€‚

 The one to 2 is going to be equal to 3ã€‚ And then I have my question mark hereã€‚

 So that tells me that the integral from 2 to 8ã€‚F of X dx question mark is7 minus threeã€‚

 which is equal to fourã€‚And then that tells me if I have twice this value because I'm interested in twice that it's going to go to8 so I can circle the value of8ã€‚

Wonderfulã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_18.png)

Okayï¼Œ next problem is a reman sum problemã€‚ I have some functionã€‚I want to figure outï¼Œ wellã€‚

 what is the Rimon sum of it using left end pointss and using three of themï¼ŸðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So if I draw myself sort of a quick graph and you don't have to do thisï¼Œ but I'd like to do thisã€‚

 so this is a graph here of9 minus x squaredã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd we are going to be going fromï¼Œ wellï¼Œ first of allã€‚

 I can sayï¼Œ when the sort of intersect the the X axisã€‚

 we know that this value here is minus3 and that value there is plus threeã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So I have a minus three and a plus threeã€‚AndNow what I'm actually asking is to go from -2ã€‚

 So a little bit to the right of that zero over here to 4ã€‚

 which is a little bit to the right of the zeroã€‚ So that's kind of interestingã€‚

 And then I'm going to also putã€‚-2 to 0ï¼Œ0 to2 and 2 to 4ã€‚ So if I'm using left endpointsã€‚

 then I'm going to be talking about this point right thereã€‚

 this point right there and this point right thereï¼Œ the ones at -2ï¼Œ0 and 2ã€‚

 you might think hold on cover aren't you going from all the went to 4ã€‚ But noã€‚

 but the final intervalï¼Œ the one that goes 2 to 4ï¼Œ using the left end point of thatã€‚ So that's only2ã€‚

 So final storyï¼Œ my sum is going to be equal to the value of F at-2ã€‚Times in interval width of twoã€‚

Plus f at zeroï¼Œ the second end point times a width of twoï¼Œ so height time spaceã€‚

 and then a height of twoï¼Œ and againï¼Œ a width of twoï¼Œ the width of two of the same every timeã€‚

But plug minus-2 in hereï¼Œ so 9 minus minus2 squared is going to be a five times 2ã€‚

 so five times 2 is 10ã€‚Plug in zeroï¼Œ I'm going to get nineï¼Œ so I get a9 times twoï¼Œ which is 18ã€‚

If I plug in a two hereï¼Œ I get again a5 times another twoï¼Œ so another 10ï¼Œ so 18 28ï¼Œ38ã€‚

 and that's my answer right thereã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_20.png)

Halfway through the multiple choiceã€‚This problem you should be on the lookout for itã€‚

 it is a fundamental theorem of calculus number oneã€‚

 and the reason that I can do or know that that's the case is first of allã€‚

 I'm looking that it's not an integral just by itself it's the derivative of the integralã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then second of all is the derivative of an integral where there is an x in that limitã€‚

 there's a square root x up to 5 of log TDTã€‚ So I want to be using my fundamental theem of calculus and to remind you that the fundamental theorem calculus says the integralã€‚

From any value of a up to xã€‚Of F of T Dtï¼Œ and this is notã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒF of Tã€‚ it is F of xã€‚

 the derivative of the interval they sort of canceledã€‚

 but there's this kind of weirdness to it in particular that if it was an integrative F of Tã€‚

 that T is a dummy variableã€‚ But this accumulation functions and function of xã€‚

 So our final answer is F of Xã€‚ Nowï¼Œ a couple problemsã€‚ Numb oneï¼Œ First of allï¼Œ I don't have an Xã€‚

 I don't even have it in the right locationã€‚ right nowã€‚

 you see how this square root of x is down here at the bottom and not up at the topã€‚

 So that's problem oneï¼Œ that I need to flip the order of thisã€‚ And I can do that fair enoughã€‚

 I can say this is negative of the derivative with respect to x of5 up to square root of x of log of T D Tã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo I take the minus sign and that flips it towards the right way so it's compatible with fundamental theorem calculus second issueã€‚

 it's not just an Xï¼Œ it's a square root of Xã€‚So I have to use a little bit of a chain rule hereã€‚

 It's not just up to Xã€‚ it's up to some function of xã€‚

 So when I do the chain rules derivative to the outside at the insideã€‚

 at the square root x times the derivative of the inside times the derivative of square root xã€‚

 So what am I going to getï¼Œ it's going to beï¼Œ wellï¼Œ that negative signã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And then the fundamental theem of calcus says the derivative of the integral cancel in the following senseã€‚

 it's logï¼Œ but not log of Tï¼Œ log of whatever the function isï¼Œ so log of root Xã€‚

And then it's multiplied by the derivative of Ruxã€‚ And so this is going to beï¼Œ wellã€‚

 one half x to the minus1 halfã€‚ And let's see whether we have that answer in thereã€‚

 It looks like we doã€‚Answer Eã€‚Allrightã€‚Moving right alongã€‚

This next question is just sort of an annoying little trickã€‚ It's just a spot of algebraã€‚

 It's not a big dealã€‚ Basicallyï¼Œ what we notice is thatï¼Œ lookï¼Œ there's a quotientã€‚

 There's no quotient rule for integrals that we're going to be busting out hereã€‚

 So we have to just use some algebra to make it look like a power ruleã€‚ And the trick is thisã€‚

 I'm going to do the integral from one up to2ã€‚ I have a sum in the numeratorã€‚

 and I'm allowed to break up the sums in numeratorã€‚

 So I can say that this is just two x over x cubedã€‚

 and x over x cubed is like just x squared on the bottomã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼Œplusã€‚

X cubed over x cubed and x cubed over x cubed is just like oneã€‚ So there we have that answerã€‚

2 over x squared plus 1ã€‚Dxï¼Œ okayï¼Œ now what can I doï¼Œ Wellã€‚

 I have to do an anti derivative of these two different thingsã€‚ Firstã€‚

 I've got the two over x squaredã€‚ So I'll put the the two out the frontã€‚This is x to the minus2ã€‚

 so it's anti grve of x to the 2 plus1ï¼Œ so x to the minus1ã€‚And thenre all divided out by minus1ã€‚

And then finally plus Xï¼Œ and then I'm going to evaluate this entire thing that I haveã€‚

Between the x values of one and twoï¼Œ two firstã€‚ So I have a minusã€‚2ï¼Œ and then the x to the -1ã€‚

 when I plug in 2 is going to be a two on the bottom plus 2ã€‚ rightï¼Œ That's plug 2 inã€‚

 And then I subtract off plugging one in hereã€‚ So I have a -2 plus1ã€‚

So I've got a minus one and a two is a1ï¼Œ minus2 and a1 is a minus1ã€‚

 because the minus sin outsidesider becomes a plus oneã€‚Plus oneã€‚2ã€‚Rightã€‚Okayã€‚

 what do we want to do hereã€‚ Nowï¼Œ lookï¼Œ it's very similar to the previous problemã€‚ It's got a sumã€‚

 But because the sum is down on the denominatorã€‚ Nowï¼Œ you can't split it up in that same wayã€‚

 We have to use a U substitutionã€‚ And what I notice is that in the denominator there's an x squared termã€‚

 But on the numeratorï¼Œ there's just an x termã€‚ And derivative x squared is a 2 xã€‚

 So outside of the two figuring outï¼Œ it looks like the derivative of the denominator is sort of up to constantã€‚

 the numeratorã€‚ So let's try thisã€‚ Let's set U equal to x squared plus1ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

And that is going to imply that my D is going to be equal to2 x dxã€‚

 and in fact I actually have four Xdxï¼Œ I have twice that valueã€‚Nowã€‚

 I have a indefinite integral hereã€‚ excuse meï¼Œ I have adefinite integralã€‚ I've got a 0 and a4 thereã€‚

 So I have to figure out what happens thereã€‚ Wellï¼Œ U at x equal to 0ã€‚

 Like if I plugged in x equal to 0 here would be  oneã€‚ and U at x equal to 4ã€‚

 if I plug in 4 for this value would be 4 squared to 16 plus 1 is 17ã€‚

So this whole thing is equal to the integral from1 up to 17ã€‚ I've switched my limits of integrationã€‚

 Can't forget that partã€‚I've got four XDxï¼Œ not two XDxã€‚

 so it is twice the value of D and then divided it out by youã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

So how do I do this while the two comes along for the rideã€‚

 the anti derivative of one over U is at log of absolute value of Uã€‚

 so log of absolute value of U and then evaluated between 1 and 17ã€‚

 which is two log of 17 minus2 log of1 and log of1 is just 0ï¼Œ so twice log of 17ã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_22.png)

We have the resultã€‚Heyï¼Œ we have one more multiple choiceï¼Œ that's itã€‚

 we're done with the multiple choice onto the rhythmã€‚Nowã€‚

I really like this particular written problemã€‚ This is one where I've got an accumulation functionã€‚

 A G of x is the integral from 0 up to x of some function F of TDTã€‚ And the graphï¼Œ not of Gã€‚

 but of F is givenã€‚ That's what I put down hereã€‚ The graph of Fã€‚

 So I have to interpret G from this graph of Fã€‚ Nowï¼Œ what kind of question do I ask about thisã€‚ Wellã€‚

 first type of question I ask is find each of the followingã€‚ First of allï¼Œ G of1ã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So if I look at what my G wasï¼Œ this is like plugging in1 because that maybe be the integral from 0 to 1 of F of x dxã€‚

 Wellï¼Œ0 to1 of F of x dx is that area right thereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒSo the integral from zero up to1 of F of x dxã€‚

 what am I going to do hereï¼Œ I'm going to say that this is just the area of that triangleã€‚And s areaã€‚

 by the wayï¼Œ this has a width of oneï¼Œ a height of2ã€‚

 So one half of base times height is just going to be oneã€‚ And because it's negativeã€‚- oneã€‚All rightã€‚

 G of9ï¼Œ well now I have to shade in all of this other stuff going all the way over to G of9 is a lot more areas to figure outã€‚

 So it's the minus1 I've already figured outã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen I have another triangle hereã€‚

 the one above the X axis I'm going to figure that one out and it's going to be a width of threeã€‚

 one half or one half based of heightï¼Œ a width of three and a height of twoã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Then I have this little portion between four and six hereï¼Œ another triangleã€‚

 so a one half width of two times a height of twoï¼Œ I then have a square which has a excuse meã€‚

 but this last one here shouldn't be a plus should be a minus sign because it's beneathã€‚

I then have another minus sign for my square going from six to eightï¼Œ which is a two times twoã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_24.png)

And then finallyï¼Œ one more one halfï¼Œ it is one half a base times heightã€‚ So a one times2ã€‚

So just basically looking at these either triangles or squares and adding them up by looking at itã€‚

 but either way G of 9 is this area moving right alongã€‚ Now we want to do G prime of7ã€‚

 And the big idea here is thisã€‚ If I look at what G prime isï¼Œ G prime is accumulation functionã€‚

 So it's derivative is the derivative of the integral from0 x of F of T Tï¼Œ butã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_26.png)

We had the fundamental theor of calculus that says the derivative of the integral of the derivative of the accumulation function is just its integralgr is just f of xã€‚

 That is this G prime of7 is just the same thing as F of7 and G double prime of 7 is therefore F prime of 7 it's sort of the derivative of the derivativeã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_28.png)

Okay so what's f of 7 and f prime of 7 looking back upï¼Œ wellã€‚

7 looks down like it's going to be the value of x equal to minus 2 so I can do thatã€‚F of7 is minus2ã€‚

And thenã€‚Prime of7ï¼Œ wellï¼Œ this is the slope at that particular valueã€‚ Wellï¼Œ the slope is horizontalã€‚

 rightï¼Œ there's no riseã€‚ and so we can say this is equal to 0ã€‚Allrightã€‚

 increasing in an absolute maximumã€‚ let's go back look at my graphã€‚ But look at my graphã€‚

 Where is this increasingã€‚ Wellï¼Œ starting at zeroï¼Œ it begins negative where you're adding sort of negative areasã€‚

 areas beneath the x axisã€‚ and then it's that positive for a whileï¼Œ goes bigï¼Œ bigï¼Œ bigã€‚

 big increasing all the area where you're adding positive stuff and then decreasing againã€‚

 So I think the maximum happens at this value of four here where you've been adding all this positive stuff going as large as you can in terms of your area under the curve and then you start going down againã€‚

 So I'm going to say that my G of x has an absolute maximum at4ã€‚

 and that it is increasing on one up fourã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_30.png)

Another way to think about this is it's increasing when its derivative is positiveã€‚

 but its derivative was just the function value of F of x and so I'm basically just asking where is this function value positive well it's positive from one to fourã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAll rightï¼Œ use substitutionã€‚The big trick with all these sub problems is trying to figure out what is a useful Uã€‚

 Likeï¼Œ if you just chose L N of Xï¼Œ then you would have like the one were not counted forã€‚

 you made the entire denominatorï¼Œ the Uã€‚ Wellï¼Œ the D would be super messyã€‚

 If you put the U to be the one plus2 L N of x cubedã€‚

 you get three times all that mess squared when you try take a derivative itã€‚

 a lot of possible use that as soon as you try thenï¼Œ they don't work outã€‚ So what does work outã€‚

 If I go and set U to be sort of the inside of the biggest chunk I can think ofã€‚ Wellã€‚

 I have a block cubedã€‚ So let's just set it to be the inside of that one plus2 L N of Xã€‚

 And then we will get U cubedã€‚ when you go and plug it inã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒThat's my Uã€‚

 then my D U is going to be equal to2 over x D Xã€‚ And I can then go and rearrange thisã€‚ Okayã€‚

 I don'tï¼Œ I see that I have an Xï¼Œ and I see that I have a D Xã€‚ I'm missing the twoã€‚

 So I have to put a half out the frontã€‚ So one halfã€‚

But then I can say this is the integral of just a D over U cubedã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

To a power rule the one half comes along for the rideã€‚

 it goes to u to the power of minus3 plus1 is minus2ï¼Œ I divide out by that minus 2ã€‚

 and I add a plus C because I'm doing an indefinite integralã€‚

Right final thing I can't just leave it is youï¼Œ I have to go and actually plug in for the value of x I had an integral in terms of xã€‚

 I want my final answer in terms of x as wellï¼Œ that's our agreementã€‚

 so I will write one half and in fact I will come along and say not one half I'm going to say that it is going to be minus one quarter when the twos multiplyã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then I'm going to have the uï¼Œ which is 1 plus2 element of x substituting it back in and all the power of minus two final plus Eã€‚

All rightï¼Œ next oneã€‚Okayï¼Œ another use of there's a natural guess for your Uã€‚ It's the inside of theã€‚

 you knowï¼Œ the power gameã€‚ We did you cubed last timeã€‚ Now we do U to the one halfã€‚ Let's try thatã€‚

 So X-4 D is very simpleã€‚ in that caseã€‚ D Xï¼Œ but there's a problemã€‚

 And the problem is this X right hereã€‚If I go and try to plug in U and I get x square root U to Uã€‚

 But how do I deal with my Xï¼Œ I have to do this thing called back substitutionã€‚

 So what I'm going to do is I'm going to rearrange my formulaã€‚

 and I'm going to say that X is going to be equal to U plus 4ã€‚

 So now when I've got the X I can make that into a U as wellã€‚

 So this is going to become the integral of U plus4 times square root of u Dã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

And now this is one I can just go and multiply outã€‚

 So this is u to the one times u to the half is u to the three halfsã€‚And for you to the one halfã€‚

 all of that multiplied by Dï¼Œ wonderfulã€‚Now I want to use my power rule to do the find anti derivative u to the three/ half plus one is u to the five/ halfã€‚

 divided up by five/ h is the same thing as multiplying by two fifthsã€‚

And then plus and I'll make the four hereï¼Œ now it goes to u to the one half plus one is u to the three/ halfã€‚

Divided by three/2sã€‚ or if you preferï¼Œ multiplyã€‚By two/3ã€‚

 and then finally it's an indefinite integralï¼Œ so I owe you a plus Cã€‚Okayã€‚

 final thing I want to do is I actually have this u it's an x minus4ï¼Œ let's go and plug that inã€‚

 so two fifthsã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒX minus4 to the five hatsã€‚Plus eight thirdsï¼Œ x minus4 to the three/2alsã€‚Plus Cã€‚

And that's a final answerã€‚All rightï¼Œ wonderfulã€‚Moving by alongã€‚Okayã€‚

 we have some sort of optimization problem it appears hereï¼Œ let's try to read itã€‚

 a tank has a rectangular base and rectangular sizeã€‚

 but open on the top so I'm a box with the open on the topã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒIt's constructedã€‚

 so it has a width of four meters and that its volume is 36 cubic metersã€‚ Okayã€‚

 so it seems like one of these three sides I've got got a widthï¼Œ the length and heightã€‚

 It sounds like the width is specified it has to be forã€‚

And when building the tank costs $10 per square meter for the base and 5 per square meter for the sizeã€‚

 you want to find the length of x such that the side of the base because the minimum cost of the tankã€‚

All rightï¼Œ so I guess we're trying to find sort of an x value we're going to write it in terms of now I notice that I have a constraint hereã€‚

My constraint is that my volume is 36 cubic metersï¼Œ so my volumeï¼Œ which isã€‚4 xã€‚

 Y base times width times heightã€‚ThatThis has to be four x yï¼Œ or sorryã€‚

 width times length times heightï¼Œ I guess four times x times yï¼Œ and all of this is equal to 36ã€‚

So that tells me X Y is9 or in other wordsï¼Œ y is9 divided out by x so I can use this a little bit later if I have a y in my formula is I want to get rid of itã€‚

 I can do thatã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒNow I want to find the cost of this thing okayã€‚

 well how can I do that one of the things that I know here is that my cost functionã€‚

 which I'm initially going to write in terms of x and yï¼Œ so I'll write cost of x and yã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_32.png)

Wellï¼Œ in this caseï¼Œ it's the cost I'm optimizingã€‚ whether the constraint was the volumeã€‚

 It could be the other way aroundï¼Œ rightï¼Œ I could go in the other directionã€‚

 give a fixed cost and ask you to optimize the volumeã€‚ But right nowã€‚

 the thing I'm trying to optimize is the costã€‚ So it says it is $10 for the baseã€‚

 The base is  four times x is only one of themã€‚ So $10 times  four times xã€‚

And then then I'm going to have5 for the sizeï¼Œ but there's two different sort of types of size as a rectangleã€‚

There's two versions Ive put to of the ones that are four times xã€‚Excuse meï¼Œ that are four times yã€‚

So that would look like one of those guys that's going to be a four times yã€‚

 but I'm also going to have these ones on the side that are like an x times yï¼Œ they also cost$5ã€‚

 there's also two of them sort of a front and a back and this one is going to be x times yã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

Now I need to use this y equals9 over x formula so that I can make my cost function entirely in terms of xã€‚

 so this is first going to be a 40 xã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒThen it's a 10ï¼Œ I've got a 40 yã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

But it's a 40 y where y is 9 overactã€‚ So 9 times 4 is 36ã€‚ So 360ã€‚Divide it out by xã€‚

And then five times two times x times yï¼Œ so 10 times y is going to becomeã€‚

 which is90rex is going to become a 90ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAnd then x over xã€‚

 so don't have to worry about I just get thisï¼Œ so there's my cost functionï¼Œ it's a function of xã€‚

Find the critical numberï¼Œ Okayï¼Œ I have to figure out what c prime of x is going to beã€‚

 Well derivative to 40 is just 40 x is just 40ã€‚Then minus 360 over x squared and our critical number is when this is going to be equal to0ã€‚

Bring in the x squared divided by 10 to make myself a life a little bit easierã€‚

 it's4 x squared is equal to 36ã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWhich means x squared is equal to9ã€‚

 which means x is equal to plus or minus3ï¼Œ and the idea of the side length of a box being negative is just such nonsense I don't have to worry about itã€‚

 It's just the positive rootã€‚ X is equal to threeã€‚ That's my critical numberã€‚Moving alongã€‚

 use the second derivative and first derivative test or the first derivative to verify that C has a minimum at the critical number because rightã€‚

 we've got this critical numberï¼Œ but it could be one of those midpoint that doesn't do anything could be a maximum who knows Wellã€‚

 if I go and look at what my C prime is right hereã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_36.png)

I'm going use first derivative testï¼Œ so C prime I'm going to come along and I'm going to put this valueã€‚

 there's my value of three Well imagine X was bigger than thatã€‚

That would mean that the negative term that I have hereã€‚

 that negative term would be a smaller negative termï¼Œ so it would be positiveã€‚

 so it's positive over hereã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒIf my x was smaller than threeã€‚

 the negative term would be more dominantï¼Œ it would become a negativeã€‚

 and so we've got a negative to a positiveï¼Œ it is therefore going to be so a minimumã€‚

So given this constrained volumeï¼Œ we have minimized the costã€‚And one more problemã€‚

 a graphing problem always like thisã€‚ This is where I give you all these different componentsã€‚

 F F primeï¼Œ F double primeï¼Œ and I try to graph themã€‚ So domainï¼Œ wellã€‚

 domain is everywhere where I don't have a division by0 or a square root of something or a log of0ã€‚

 any of those types of problemsã€‚ E the x is never  zeroã€‚ So the domain is everythingã€‚

 minus infinity to infinityã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒIf I wanted to set x equal to0ï¼Œ then that would give me my f was 0ã€‚

 my y was 0ã€‚ If I wanted to set my y was 0ï¼Œ that would give me my x equal to0ã€‚

 so there's only one intercept it's 0ï¼Œ0ï¼Œ it's both the x and the y interceptã€‚ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒAllrightï¼Œ next upã€‚

 F is increasing where F prime is positiveã€‚ So I want to know where my f prime is positive hereã€‚

 and I notice that I have this value of one and that if I' am bigger than oneã€‚

 it's negative and if it's smaller than oneï¼Œ it's going to be positiveã€‚

 So I can say that it's increasing on minus infinity up to that value of oneã€‚

Concave up now I'm going to do my second derivativeã€‚

 one similar kind of idea when it's to the right thoughï¼Œ it's positive and to the left is negativeã€‚

 that's f prime and F double primeï¼Œ so concave up on two up to infinityã€‚Okayã€‚

 vertical lotss and toes are where the denominator is zeroï¼Œ so there are noneã€‚

 the denominator is never zeroã€‚ðŸ˜¡ã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_38.png)

Okayï¼Œ horizontal laintesã€‚ This iss where you excludes a positive infinity or minus infinity do positive infinity first E to the x goes to positive infinityã€‚

 So x divided by e to the x that's going to be going down to 0ã€‚

 So we have a horizontal horizontal ayote of0 on the right on the leftã€‚ Wellï¼Œ what happens hereã€‚

 If you go to minus infinityï¼Œ E to the minus infinity is 0ã€‚ you get an x over a0ã€‚

 So this is going to be blowing upã€‚ So we have a one sided horizontal ainote of y equal to 0ã€‚

 and that only occurs on the right hand sideã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_40.png)

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_41.png)

Alrightï¼Œ so let's use all the pieces of information we know and try to graph this thing The first thing I like to plug in is just anything where you've got to actual sort of a pointã€‚

 so for exampleï¼Œ for x equal to zeroï¼Œ I have that point right there that was going to be the X and Y interceptã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ï¼ŒWhat else did we know Wellï¼Œ we knew that eventually we have a horizontal lasmtat over hereã€‚

 so this is going to the value of y equal to zeroã€‚ and remember that horizontal lasytat was only from the rightã€‚

Okay then we also know that from the leftï¼Œ this is going to be going to minus infinity so sort of as x goes to minus infinityã€‚

 the function value also goes to minus infinityï¼Œ so we have some sort of you know thing on the left hereã€‚

 which is going to be going down as wellã€‚Nowã€‚What else do I knowï¼Œ We knowã€‚

 and I'm going to sort of put this up over here on the top is that we knowã€‚From2 to minus infinityã€‚

 that's the portion where it is concave downã€‚And then we know that from minus infinity all the way up to oneã€‚

 this is the portion where it's increasingã€‚So we saw those intervals as wellã€‚

 So I'm sort of keep those in my mindã€‚ and I know that I have this sort of value of oneã€‚

 I can sort of figure out what happens thereï¼Œ and I have this value of  twoã€‚

 Those were the two interesting placesã€‚ So at2ï¼Œ it was an inflection pointã€‚

 went from concave up to concave downã€‚

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_43.png)

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_44.png)

And at oneï¼Œ wellï¼Œ it's gonna to be a maximum goes from increasing to decreasingã€‚

 One other thing I can do is I have this maximum one and this inflection point of 2ã€‚

 I can figure out what the heights of those are going beã€‚

 Like if I go back and I try to plug in x equal to1ã€‚

 that's the maximum or x equal to2 and I plug it in thereã€‚ Well I getï¼Œ for exampleï¼Œ1ï¼Œ1 over Eã€‚

 that's a fraction at some number less than1ã€‚ And if I plug in 2ã€‚

 I get two over e squared Also a fraction less than1ã€‚ So I don't know exactly what those values areã€‚

 But I can see that if I have my sort of graph hereã€‚ they're both gonna be less than1ã€‚



![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_46.png)

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_47.png)

![](img/4722502e3af87870840998830c3ae32e_48.png)

So let's try to put all the pieces of information togetherã€‚ so we know that going up to oneã€‚

 it is increasing in a concave downed wayã€‚ so I can sort of take this graph hereã€‚

Increasing increase increasingï¼Œ but con down it goes through 0ï¼Œ0ã€‚

 and I'm going to stop it right there and have this maximum some number between0 and one hereã€‚

Then I know it is going to start decreasingï¼Œ but still in a concaved down wayã€‚

 So decreasing in a concave down way and at the value of 2ã€‚

 it's my inflection point and it switches to being decreasing still But now it's going to be concave upã€‚

 So there's not a lot of room to here because I my heights are kind of low hereã€‚

 But I'm going to be decreasing in a concave down way hits the inflection point and now decreasing in a concave up way and to sort of flattens out to go into the horizontal lasytoe at y equal to0ã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒSo my big sort of strategy for these types of problems is plug in the pointsï¼Œ you knowã€‚

 like the interceptsï¼Œ like the critical numbersï¼Œ like the inflection points that gives you a few sort of dotsã€‚

 and then you fill in the dots by lookingï¼Œ is it increasing or decreasing and is it concave up or concave down in each of the regions that you're consideringã€‚

ðŸ˜¡ã€‚
