initializing it with 4 comma 2 what's a，line of code that changes the color from。

whatever it initially is to read the，first one car dot paint red is sort of。

attempting to do the the way that we saw，on the right in the slides where you're。

calling the class name dot but it's，missing the self so we don't know what。

object to call it on so that one's out，of the running the second one is closer。

but we have red here as a variable as，opposed to a string so that one's not，not going to work。

the third one looks good and the fourth，one is just weird I don't think that one。

will work it's attempting to put a value，for self but you've already called my。
