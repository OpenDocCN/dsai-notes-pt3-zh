so I have here first part is just the，top part so I have some blank line and。

then I'm defining a method named speak，so write a line to replace blank that。

creates a class for a dog that inherits，from animal ok so the first thing I。

notice is that I need to write a，so my choices are these so I can I can。

tell it's either the first or the third，one and then I want to inherit from。

animal so I don't want to inherit from，object but I want to inherit from animal。

right so that's perfect next question，says with this definition of dog you run。

a program with those three lines what，happens okay so this is my definition。

and I have these three lines let's go，down here nice okay so with these three。

lines it says this first line says D is，equal to dog 7 so I'm creating a dog。

object with age 7 is this is a line，going to throw an error well this line。

actually looks for an init method this，particular class definition doesn't have。

a init method but hey I'm inheriting，from someone I'm inheriting from animal。

does animal have an init method and it，does as we saw in the slides okay so。

we're creating a new dog with age 7 and，name none next so that line doesn't。

throw an error the next line sets the，name to ruffles and again I don't have a。

set name method inside this particular，class but does my animal class my parent。

class have a setname method and yes it，does right here so I call that one so。

that line does not throw an error and，the third line says d dot speak which。

which is going to cause python to look，in this current class definition and it。

says hey I have a method here named，speak so I'm gonna use this one and it's。

going to print ruff ruff because it's a。
