so we have a class car here object as as，usual the init method here takes himself。

as usual a WN daddy so so car gets，initialized with two parameters。

and we assign the wheels data attribute，to the first one and the door's data。

attribute to the second one and then，we're going to also assign a color data。

attribute to be the empty string so I'm，giving you four choices here and the。

question says which of the above is a，getter method for the number of wheels。

okay so get our method is something，that's going to get a data attribute a。

method is really just a function so of，course we're going to have DF get Wheels。

is a good name for it since the method，for this class we have to have self in。

the parameters so we know it's going to，be between C and D and so then what are。

we going to return the first one is，going to return wheels which in this。

particular case is just going to be a，variable that we haven't defined what。

it's a variable a getter returns a data，attribute over particular instance so we。

actually have to say self dot if we want，to return a data attribute of an。

instance as opposed to just a regular。
