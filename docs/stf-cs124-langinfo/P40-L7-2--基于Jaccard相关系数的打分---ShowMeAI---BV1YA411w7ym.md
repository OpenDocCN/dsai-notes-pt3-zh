As a first simple example of the ranked retrieval modelã€‚

 let's consider scoring with the Jaard coefficientã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

So the Jacard coefficient is a commonly used measure for the overlap between two sets A and Bã€‚

 and what it is is simply you take the number of items in the intersection of A and B and you divide it by the number of items in the union of A and Bã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒAnd so if we take the Jaard coefficient of a set with itselfã€‚

 then the set has some size and then that size will be also the size of the intersection in the union and so the ratio be1 and the Jaard coefficient is oneã€‚

ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒIf two sets are disjoint and have no members in commonã€‚

 then the numerator of the Jaard coefficient will be zero and so the Jaard coefficient is zeroã€‚

Now the two sets don't have to be the same sizeï¼Œ but you should be able to see that the Jaard coefficient will always assign a number between zero and1 because at most the intersection can be as large as the unionã€‚

So suppose we decided to make the query document match score the Jaard coefficient computed for the sets of words that the two documents contain so the idea is that let's suppose our query is Is of March which has these three words and then we have these two documents so what we can do is say so there are three different words hereã€‚

And then for document 1ï¼Œ Caesar doesn't occur in itã€‚ die doesn't occur in itã€‚ in doesn't occur in itã€‚

 March does occur in itã€‚ So the size of the intersectionã€‚Is just one wordã€‚

 and the total number of words is 6ã€‚If we then do the second documentï¼Œ wellã€‚

 that doesn't occur in the queryï¼Œ long doesn't occur in the queryã€‚

 but again March does occur in the queryã€‚ so this time the ja card coefficient of D1ã€‚Comedy 2ã€‚

Is going to be one divided by the number of wordsï¼Œ whichã€‚Is this time5ã€‚ Okayã€‚

 and so this document is going to win as having the higher Jaard scoreã€‚ Nowï¼Œ of courseï¼Œ thatã€‚

Difference may not seem very significantã€‚Essentiallyã€‚

 this document is winning here just because it's shorterã€‚ but if we imaginedã€‚

A different example where we maybe had the wordIs in the second document then we'd get that the Jaard coefficient fored is now two overlapping words over sixã€‚

 and that maybe makes more sense to you that you're getting more overlap so the Jaard score is higherã€‚

 but this idea that all else being equal a shorter document should be preferred is a common one that we'll see again in IR modelsã€‚

Okayï¼Œ so is Jaard scoring a good idea for retrieval model in general it's not felt to be it has a couple of issuesã€‚

 one is that it doesn't consider term frequencyï¼Œ it just uses the set of words in a documentã€‚

 ignores how many times the words occur in a documentã€‚

But that's typically not all the information we wantã€‚ðŸ¤¢ã€‚

And we'll look at models in a minute that do deal with term frequencyã€‚

 There's also a second finer point which is that rare terms in a collection are more informative and frequent terms when evaluating a queryã€‚

 and that's something that we'll also want to factor into our modelsã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

There's one other aspect in which the Jaard coefficient turns out not to work very wellã€‚

 And that is the way in which it does normalization by dividing through by the union isn't necessarily quite rightã€‚

 I meanï¼Œ in particularï¼Œ later on in these segmentsï¼Œ we'll introduce the ideaã€‚



![](img/f53bc15c676870c581cce9374b5fa176_3.png)

Of using cosine similarityã€‚And we'll go through the math of that for the more general caseã€‚

 But if after you've seen thatï¼Œ you want to kind of come back to this and work out what the cosine similarity score isã€‚

 if you just have a 1ï¼Œ0ã€‚Bag of words and work out a cosine scoreï¼Œ it'll turn out that it thisã€‚

 which is like the Jaard coefficient except that we've got this slight difference in the denominator that we're now taking the square root of the unionã€‚

 and that actually turns out to be a better form of length normalizationã€‚ðŸ˜Šï¼ŒOkayï¼ŒðŸ˜Šã€‚

I introduced the Jaard coefficient just as a very simple example of a ranked retrieval modelã€‚

 but I hope it was also a way to show some of the issues that we need to deal with in a good retrieval modelã€‚

 how to factor in the frequency of termsï¼Œ the rareness of wordsã€‚

 and how to normalize the score for different document lengthsã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚
