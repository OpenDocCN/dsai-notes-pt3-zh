In this lectureï¼Œ we'll introduce the topic of text classification and the naive Bays algorithmã€‚

 which is one of the most important ways of doing text classificationã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_2.png)

Let's begin by looking at some examples of text classification applicationsã€‚

Here I've shown an email that I actually received the other dayã€‚

How do I know that this email is spamï¼ŸTake a look at the mail and think of some features you might automatically extract from this email that tells you that it's spamã€‚

You might notice the wordatesï¼Œ a misspelling of greatï¼Œ so we have a typo hereã€‚

Maybe you might notice important notice and maybe an exclamation pointã€‚

 it's pretty rare that universities put exclamation points in their subject headersã€‚

You might notice that there's noã€‚Dan hereã€‚ Noï¼Œ it's not addressed to me in particularã€‚

 we have undisclosed recipients and there's no particular addressã€‚

 And the URL is a little funny hereã€‚ Thiss not a Stanford URLã€‚Maybe the word excitingã€‚

Each of these features can be combined in a classifier to give us some evidence that we've got a piece of spamã€‚

Another important text classification task is authorship attributionã€‚

How do I know which author wrote which piece of textï¼Ÿ



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_6.png)

One of the most famous examples of authorship attribution is the famous anonymous essays called the Federalist Papers that were written at the beginning of the history of our country in part to convince the state of New York to ratify the early Constitutionã€‚

And three authors wrote various numbers of the lettersï¼Œ but 12 of the lettersã€‚

 it wasn't clear which author wroteã€‚ And in 1963ï¼Œ theã€‚And in 1963ã€‚

 Moslar and Wallace showed that Bayesian methods were able to distinguish which letters were written by Madison and which letters were written by Hamiltonã€‚

And the Bayesian methods that they used in 1963 gave rise to the naive Bayes method that we're going to be talking about todayã€‚

Another text classification task is gender identification determining if an author is male or femaleã€‚

Recent research in gender identification has shown that we can look at the number of pronouns and other featuresã€‚

 the number of determinersï¼Œ the number of noun phrases are subtly indicative of the difference between male and female writersã€‚

Female writers tend to use more pronouns and male writers tend to use more facts and determiners in their noun phrasesã€‚

 and you can see from that thatã€‚Here we have a lot of pronounsã€‚

And here we have a lot of determiners and factual sentences with cop of verbsã€‚

 and so you might determine that this is in fact a maleï¼Œ and this is a femaleã€‚

 and that would be correctï¼Œ this is the author Margaret Drabble and this is the author Anthony Grayã€‚

Another text classification task is sentiment analysis and one of the classic sentiment analysis tasks is movie review identificationã€‚

 given a reviewï¼Œ whether it's a movie or a productã€‚

 can I tell whether this review is positive or negativeã€‚

 and although I'm going to show you an example here from moviesã€‚

 this could apply to any product review for any any product or service that you might find on the Web so this is actually a very important commercial applicationã€‚

So suppose we saw a review that said unbelievably disappointingã€‚

Well that's clearly a negative review How about full of zany characters and richly applied satireã€‚

 positiveï¼ŸHow about this is the greatest schoolball comedy ever filmedã€‚

 where I've got words like greatest or greatest everï¼Œ that's very positiveã€‚ðŸ˜Šã€‚

How about it was patheticï¼Œ The worst part about it was the boxing scenes hereã€‚

 we've got evidence like pathetic and worst and so on to tell us that this isï¼Œ in factã€‚

 a negative reviewã€‚

![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_8.png)

Text classification oftenã€‚We also apply text classification to scientific articlesï¼Œ for exampleã€‚

 deciding what the topic of a particular article in a database like MedDline might beã€‚For exampleã€‚

 we might have to decide in automatically indexing an article which of various subjectsã€‚

 antagonists or blood supply or drug therapy or epidemiology apply to any particular article that's written that's in our databaseã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_10.png)

So in summaryï¼Œ text classification is the task of assigning any kind of topic category to any piece of text and that could be subject categories in some kind of an online databaseã€‚

 it can be detecting spamï¼Œ it can be choosing an author from a set of authorsã€‚

 choosing their gender or maybe it's their ageï¼Œ you want to find young writers or old writers telling if a language if a text was written in one language versus another languageã€‚

 and the important commercial application of sentiment analysisã€‚

 all of these are examples of text classificationã€‚

![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_12.png)

Let's define the task of text classificationã€‚We have as inputï¼Œ a document Dã€‚

And then a fixed set of classesï¼Œ a set C with J classes C 1ï¼Œ2 up till C Jã€‚ And our goalã€‚

 given this document and the set of classesï¼Œ is to predictã€‚A class C from that set of classesã€‚

 So our job is to take a document and assign a class to that documentã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_14.png)

How do we do thisï¼ŸThe simplest possible text classification method is to use handwritten rulesã€‚

So for exampleï¼Œ if we're doing spam detectionï¼Œ we might just have a list of bad email addressesã€‚

 a blacklist that these people are probably spammersã€‚

Or we might look for phrases like millions of dollarsã€‚ Or you have been selectedã€‚

 These are good indications that we have spanã€‚ And if these rules are carefully refined by an expertã€‚

 you can get high accuracy from handwritten rulesã€‚ But in generalã€‚

 building and maintaining these rules is expensiveã€‚

So although hand coded rules are often used as part of a system of text classificationã€‚

 we generally combine that with an important method for machine learningã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_16.png)

This method is supervised machine learningã€‚ So in supervised machine learningã€‚

We have a document D just as we did before and a fixed set of classes as we did beforeã€‚

 but we need one more thing nowï¼Œ we need a training set of some documents that have been handlabeled for their class so we have for document1ã€‚

 we know that it's in class1 for document 2 it's in some other class and maybe for document M we have a label for the class of document Mã€‚

 So given the documentï¼Œ the set of classes and the fixed and the training set of hand labelbeled documentsã€‚

 the goal of machine learning is to produce a classifier and we'll use gamma to refer to the classifier and gammas a function that given a new document will give us the classã€‚

 So given a set of training labels of documents in classes we'll learn a classifier that maps a document to a classã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_18.png)

There's lots of kinds of machine learning classifiers we're going to talk today about naive Baysã€‚

 but we see we'll look later in the course we'll talk about logistic regression and we'll touch on other kinds of classifiers like support vector machines also called SVMsã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_20.png)

Ken nearest neighborsï¼Œ lots of other classifiersã€‚No matter which classifier we useã€‚



![](img/4ad1c5f0ae8ad597eaf9bc5bf2a784e2_22.png)

The task of text classification is to take a documentï¼Œ its textï¼Œ other kinds of featuresã€‚

 and extract features that represent the document and build a classifier that can tell us which class the document belongs toã€‚
