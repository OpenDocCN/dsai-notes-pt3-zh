- en: In this Excel tutorial， I'm going to show you how to use the and function。 which
    is a great function that requires multiple things to be true in order for something
    to happen or to return the result of true。 if those multiple things aren't true，
    then it returns the result of falses。 So let's take a look at a couple of examples
    of this and how you might use it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see here in this spreadsheet， I have an employee list from a fictional
    company。 And let's say the management of this company has decided to give a bonus
    to every member of the sales department that has at least five years in the company
    and has received a performance evaluation of at least6。
  prefs: []

- en: How would I do that， how would I calculate that automatically in Excel。 Well。
    with the and function it's easier than you would expect。 I would just start here
    in F2 type equals and left parenthesis。 And then I start putting in logical tests。
    And every logical test that I put in here must be true in order to return the
    result of true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if anyone。Of these is false。 it will return the result fault So let's begin
    and left parenthesis and then comes logical test number one B2 and I can just
    type that or I can click on B2 is greater than let's say four So if it's greater
    than four it'll be five years in the company or more now I put in the comma and
    my second logical test which is performance evaluation that needs to be at least6
    or higher and this time I think I'll just click so D2 is greater than5 and I put
    in another comma and now my third logical test E2 needs to equal sales Now because
    the word sales is a word and not a number I need to put this inside of quotation
    marks So sales quotation mark and then I should put the right parenthesis sometimes
    you don't have to do that but I'll do it anyway in this case I tap enter and look
    it looks like Gina pullin。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: she has been in the company more than four years。Her performance evaluation
    is higher than5。 and she's a member of the sales department。 Okay Now the good
    news is I don't have to recreate that same formula for each of the employees。
    All I have to do is click and drag this green square the autofill handle just
    drag it down the page or the easiest way is just to double click on it。 it copies
    it all the way down as far as the data goes and we can see that several people
    in this company have earned a bonus Now let's take this to another level。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say instead of just true and false， what if I want something to be printed
    here。 something more meaningful like bonus or no bonus or certificate or congratulations
    or whatever it might be that might go into this cell instead of the very simplistic
    true or false。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: how would I do that Well， what we could do is use an if function And if you
    haven't already watched my tutorials on the if function and also on the ifs function
    with an S at the end。 I highly recommend that you do so。Some very exciting things
    that you can do with if or ifs in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we'll just use the if function。 So equals if left parenthesis。 and now we're
    going to nest the word and inside of this if function。 So I'll put in the word
    and So if and and then whatever I put in next everything here must be true。 So
    if and left parenthesis B2 is greater than4 and and I'm putting a comma there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now our second logical test D2 is greater than5 and I put another comma E2 is
    equal to and in quotation marks sales。 Now it's important at this point to put
    in the right parenthesis I really have to do at this time。 And the reason why
    is because that now closes off the nested and function and the formula that goes
    with it So that part is done Now I need to go back and finish off the if part
    of the formula。 So if all of this is true then。But the way you indicate then in
    this case is you put a comma。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So then I want to print。 So I'll put this in quotation marks， the word bonus。
    Now， of course。 this isn't going to print it on a printer。 It's going to print
    it on the screen in this cell。 Now。 what if it's not equal to bonus。 I could just
    stop the formula here with a right parenthesis tapap enter。 and you can see it
    says bonus， if I double click on the autofill handle。 It copies it down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but it still says false for those that haven't earned a bonus So if I want to
    change that。 I could add another comma after bonus， and let's read the formula。
    If each of these things are true。 then print bonus。 and then the next comma signifies
    if not， then print what How about nothing。 and I put that in quotation marks tap
    enter。 and then I'll copy that formula down by double clicking on the autofill
    handle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now we can see some people have earned a bonus， some people have earned
    nothing。 But I hope you can see the power of the and function。 It's a way to。That
    multiple things be true。 If they are true， the word true is printed。 If they're
    not true， the word false is printed。 If you want it to be something else。 besides
    true faults。

- en: you can use the and function inside of an if function。 And there really are
    some brilliant things that you can do with this and creative useful ways that
    you can use them in your spreadsheets。 Thanks for watching， I hope you found this
