    Tensorflowlow not without extraordinary effort Mac do not support Nvidia GPs and
    Tensorflowlow has also dropped GPU support for the Mac a while a while back Now
    there is very very new capabilities in the M1 Macintoshs that use the ARM chip
    that Apple has developed this is very very new and I have not gone through this
    yet I don't own an M1 Mac currently but this is something I might cover more in
    the future Any have experience with M1 TensorFlow definitely post in the comments
    I'd love to hear about what your results been so let's get to it what I am going
    to suggest you do is download and install Minconda This is available on the Mac
    get the latest version you can 3838 is all„ÄÇ

- en: So what well be installing Tensorflow for because it supports that version on
    the Macintosh I'm going get the Pkg that's a little bit easier to install than
    the bash bash is pretty similar to how you install it on Linux so you may want
    to go down that route but the instructions will be a little bit different you
    can install the full blown Anaconda if you want to I tend to prefer the more minimalistic
    just the package is that I need that way I know what I've installed into this
    beast but if you want to do Anaconda that's that's certainly fine as well you
    would just go to the Anaconda page that looks just like this and download it I'm
    going open that package file that I just got click continue continue license Yes
    I agree installation type I'm going to let it install to its default location
    which is perfectly fine by me click install it needs to authenticate me„ÄÇ

- en: And now it's going through the installation„ÄÇ This may take a little while„ÄÇ so
    I'm going to go ahead and fast forward„ÄÇ OkayÔºå this is installed„ÄÇ I'll go ahead
    and click low minus we'll move it to the track„ÄÇ So now I'm going to go back to
    the installation instructions that I had here that we were following from I am
    going to go to a terminal pro Now Mac did switch from bash to Khe So you can or
    Zhell actually so if you do P it'll show you that you are on Zhell if you're not
    on Z shell you'll probably want to switch to that there's other articles on how
    to do that if you bought a recent Mac it'll be already on Zhe but be aware of
    that that can cause you some issues Also make sure that you have the latest the
    version of Python that you expect Python minus minus version 3„ÄÇ

    if you're on 27 which is the ancient version of Python that Mac come with„ÄÇReboot
    hopefully that will help if not then you need to get the path updated and there's
    articles on the internet about how to do that„ÄÇ

- en: but really Python Minconda should automatically install that for you so I'm
    going to do Conda install minus Y Jupiter and this will get the Jupiter notebook
    install for me I'm going to fast forward through this this sometimes takes a bit„ÄÇOkay
    we've got Jupiter so next part we're going to basically use this Tensorflow YMl
    file that I make available and we're going to just download that file so I'm going
    to open it up you can see it here this may be different later on if I've updated
    just a few things in here to later versions but have not needed to rerecord the
    video yet so I am going to just put it in my users's Jheaton directory you'll
    put it in your users's directory that's not the best place to put it but it'll
    work for this example I suggest removing it after you're done so here I'm in users
    Jayheaton or whoever you happen to be and I'm going to go back and we're going
    to do this command copy it that command might be different I don't think I'll
    change that command but always copy and paste don't copy it right from YouTube
    and I'm going to go ahead and run This will create for me a Tensorflow environment
    that way I can have a different version in that environment„ÄÇ

- en: Python than I actually have in my host environment and it just keeps everything
    nice and organized that way you're not going to accidentally damage your Tensorflow
    environment when you're installing„ÄÇ say other packages in Python„ÄÇ So here we're
    installing it this will get us Tensorflow at least as of January 2021 when I'm
    recording this itll give you Python 38 and Tensorflow 2„ÄÇ

- en: 4 which is what we're using for the current semester of this course„ÄÇ now this
    tends to take a little bit„ÄÇ So I'm going fast forward through this„ÄÇ All right
    now we can go ahead and activate this environmentnda activate Tensorflow„ÄÇ And
    this is what you'll want to do every time you're going to bring up a Jupiter notebook
    just to make sure you're in that environment„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I did that activate now I'm going to do install and be this lets me actually
    add this environment to a Jupiter notebook and there we go this might take a little
    bit So I will fast forward„ÄÇ proceed Yes and fast forward this is important„ÄÇ We
    will register environment„ÄÇ

- en: Otherwise it will not show up„ÄÇJupiterÔºå so I'm gonna copy that whole big long
    command„ÄÇ I don't want to type that„ÄÇ make sure you have the 3A to be whatever version
    you have in the Tensorflow file I'll update those but copy and paste here because
    this will probably be later version later in the year or beyond I usually get
    about years worth of mileage sometimes six months before I have torecord these
    video I'm going pace and we'll have that that is very quick now we're going to
    test Jupiter and I give you some code here that we are going to want to try out
    in Jupiter I'm going go Jupiter notebook and it will launch Jupiter notebook form
    right in my browser I'm going create a new Python 3 Tensorflow and there it is
    can see it's up there and it should be running you shouldn't see kernel failed
    or something horrible like that I'm going to copy this code here and we're going
    run this this might take a little bit of time on first execution so I will fast
    forward that right this is awesome Kara's 2„ÄÇ

    but hey it's a Macin GPUs are great but just not an option that is really available
    on a Mac be a laptop or a desktop for watching this video and this channel so
    that you can stay up to date with this course and continue your deep learning
