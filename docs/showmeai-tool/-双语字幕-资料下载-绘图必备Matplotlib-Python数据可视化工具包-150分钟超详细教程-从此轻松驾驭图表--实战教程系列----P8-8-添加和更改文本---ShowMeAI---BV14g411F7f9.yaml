- en: You'll notice that we haven't added any titles。 We haven't added any labels。
    We haven't messed with any of the text。 We've just been doing the graphing with
    the exception of our our legend here。 which which gets placed automatically。 So
    let's have a section now in what section is going to be。 I think， number 4。 right，
    Are we on section， section 4。 yep， Section number 4， moving right along。

- en: So adding and altering text， this is a very important part of graphing because
    you want to give people information about what they're looking at。 you know you
    want to label your X axis， like what is 50， what is this number even stand for。
    You want to label your Y axis， know what are we looking at and then you want to
    give the graph some title。 some helpful title so that people are able to understand
    the context of the data and what you're trying to communicate。

    you can change the font family so you can change the type of font。 You can change
    the font size。 One of the ones that we're going to use is you can change the rotation
    of the text。 So you've got all of these different。

    axis with an I。 as opposed to a Cs with an E like that so。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_31.png)

- en: Let's see here maybe what we want to do。Is we want to look at this bar graph。Of
    cholesterol。 Well。 we want to look at a bar graph of cholesterol by age。 So I'll
    copy this plot down here。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_35.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    color， and the label。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_37.png)

- en: So first things first， our audience has no idea what the axis。 the x axis and
    the y axis are supposed to mean here。So the way that we do that is I'll actually
    show you on the object first。 So A X。 I'll hit dot hit tab。 Let's look at all
    of our different methods here。 So it's the set。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you'll start seeing all the different things that you can set。 come up here
    as I type in set set underscore。X， so you can set the bounds， the limit。 We're
    going to set the X label。 So we're going to set the X label here。 And what is
    our x。 Well。 that is the， that's the age。 So let's go ahead and copy this up here。And
    there you go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you see the word age printed down here now as our X axis label。If we want to
    do the same thing for the y axis， well， we just change this to set y label。 and
    what is this， is going to be average。Cholesterol。Average cholesterol there。And
    there is our Y axis label。So now what if we want to give this plot a handy dandy
    title。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I will go ahead and copy this down。 Let's create a new section header here
    called。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_39.png)

    if there's a set title set there is right there。 Look at that。 I already knew
    that， but you didn't know that， so。It was still a surprise for one of us AX dot
    set title。And let's look at let's。
  prefs: []

- en: let's say average cholesterol by age。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_44.png)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there you go。Average cholesterol by age now， as the title。OfAnd we're doing
    this on the AX object。 So this is the title。Of this axes， the title of this axes。
    and this will actually come into play in just a second here。![](img/9fb8d9dd04796c9d352a78350c807c17_46.png)

- en: So。These are two of the main things you're really going to want to know for
    adding and altering text。 and we're going to do some more with text later in the
    common questions section。 but for now for now let's go ahead and just leave it
    as the access labels and the plot title since these are going to be some of the
    main things that you will use。
