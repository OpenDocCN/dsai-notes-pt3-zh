- en: So what I'm going to do now is I'm in my Maplot Lib tutorial folder。 I'm going
    to run Jupiter notebook， and， and we're going to do the rest of this Maplotlib
    tutorial。![](img/892da33aad000f8edbbf075405535965_1.png)

- en: So this is our Jupyter notebook interface。 I'm going to， to open up a new Python
    3。Newebook。Let's name it Maplot Lib tutorial up here。And we are good to go。 The
    first thing we're going to do here is I'm going to create a mark down cell by
    typing the letter M。 And I'm going get into here and make a header1。 And I'm going
    to say， set up notebook。😊。

- en: So the first thing that I like to do in a notebook。 whenever I'm doing data
    visualization using Mapl Lib is you do this。Percent sign， mappl Lib。Inline。So。We
    don't have to spend too much time on this right here。 but essentially there are
    different ways that you can run data visualization in Maplotlib。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in Jupiter notebooks， Mapllootlib in line is going to be one of your most
    popular。 most common choices。 I would just set this up， put it as one of the first
    cells in the notebook and then kind of forget about it。So let's， let's let's get
    closer to diving into some actual data visualization here because the thing about
    mapplot Lib。That you will very quickly learn。There is so much power that it can
    be overwhelming and there are so many options that it can be extremely overwhelming。

- en: I'm going to try to start you off with some of the simplest stuff that we can
    do。 And then we're going to add on complexity there， but I definitely want you
    to。Limit the number of things you're thinking about originally。 So let's go ahead
    and get started。 So import matpllib do Pipl。 And this is the main plotting submodule
    here that we're going to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Matpl Lib has various other submods， which you can see by typing tab by hitting
    the tab key。 And then you can see all of these different submods that Matpllib
    has。 there's a ton of stuff here。 But anyways， Pi plot。And then we import it as
    PLT。And this is going to be the way that you're pretty much always going to import
    mat plot Lib here。
