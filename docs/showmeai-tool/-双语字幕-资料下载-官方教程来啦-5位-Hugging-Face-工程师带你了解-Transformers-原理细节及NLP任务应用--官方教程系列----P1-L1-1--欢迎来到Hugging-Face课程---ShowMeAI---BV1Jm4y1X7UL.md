# 【双语字幕+资料下载】官方教程来啦！5位 Hugging Face 工程师带你了解 Transformers 原理细节及NLP任务应用！＜官方教程系列＞ - P1：L1.1- 欢迎来到Hugging Face课程 - ShowMeAI - BV1Jm4y1X7UL

Welcome to the Aing F Cour。His course has been designed to teach you all about the Uface ecosystem。

We to use it at a Se Me hub， as well as open source libraries。Here is a table of contents。

As you can see， is divided into three sections which becomes progressively more advanced。

At this stage， only the first section has been released。

 which will teach you the basics of how to use a transformer model， fine it on your own dataset set。

 and share the result with the community。We are actively working on the next two sections。

The general timeline wave in mind is to have section 2 released in the fall of 2021 and the last section falls the end of 2021。

 beginning of 2022。Was that justmates so don't be ready for a bit late。

The first chapter requires no technical knowledge and is a good introduction to learn what transfer models can do and how they could be of use to you or your company。

The next switch chapters require a good knowledge of Python and so basic knowledge of machine learning and deeping。

If you don't know what the training and validation set are or what gradient de means。

 you should look at an introductory course such as the ones published by deeping the TaI or as the TaI。

It's also best if you have some basics in one deep learning framework by dorch or tonor flow。

Each part of the material introduced in this course has a version in both was frameworks。

 so we'll be able to pick the one you are most comfortable with。

This is the team that developed this course。I'll now let each of the speakers introduce themselves briefly。

Hi， my name is Matthew and I'm a machine learning engineer at Hugingfaceace。

 I work on the open source team and I'm responsible for maintaining particularly the Tensorflow code there。

Previous， I was a machine learning engineer at parsley who have recently been acquired by Auto。

 and I was a postdoctoral researcher before that at Trinity College Dublin in Ireland working on computational genetics and retinal disease。

😊，Hi， Im Alexander I'm a machine engineer at Huging Face。

 I work specifically on the open source team。I've been in a tugging face for a few years now and I've been working alongside my team members on most of the tools that you'll see in this course。

😊，Hi， I'm Sylvan， I'm a research engineer at TechFase and one of the main maintainers of the Transformers Library。

Previously， I worked at FAA AI where I helped develop the FastAI library as well as the online M。

Before that， I was a math computer science teacher in France。Yeah。
