- en: Hi， folks， and welcome to another episode of Tableau in two minutes。 Today。
    We're going to show you how to create a bullet graph。 Bullet graphs are a great
    way of displaying data where you have a goal and then some sort of achievement
    towards that goal。 So we're going to connect to some data that has some sales
    goals in it for some imaginary salespeople that I just made up here。

- en: And so you can see that our salesperson goals， data has data for John， Jim。
    James and Jeff are four salespeople by month。 along with their sales and their
    goal for that particular month。😊。![](img/c5398f00a344113deb167264c7ddec96_1.png)

- en: Now， the easiest way to create one of these is just to drag salespeople over
    salesperson over to the row shelf。 drag goal and sales to the columns shelf， and
    then use the showme function to create a bullet graph。 And then you can see that
    the bar represents the goal。 and the black line represents sales。 That's not really
    the way round that that makes sense。
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we can actually swap those quite easily by just clicking swap reference line
    fields。 Now we have goal。😊，By these represented by these lines。 And then we have
    the sales this blue bar。 which is representing what they actually sold。 So obviously。
    when that's higher than the the black line， then they exceeded their goal。 Now。
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's all very good to be able to create it with the show me feature。 But I think
    you get a bit more customization if you're able to to create it yourself。 So what
    they're going do is drag salesperson over to the row shelf。 We're going to drag
    sales up to our columns shelf。 And that creates our bars。
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we're going to drag gold to the detail shelf。😊，We're gonna add a reference
    line。This reference line we're going to do per cell。 So there's one per bar。It's
    going to set that to total。 We're going to set this to the sum of the goal。We're
    going to make our line a little bit thicker and a little bit darker。
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then we're going to remove the label so that we just have this bar。 which
    shows us what the goal was for each of our individual salespeople。 Now。 you'll
    note that if we look back at this one， there's also some shading under this。 that's
    easily done。 So again， we're going to add another reference lines at a second
    reference line。
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this time， we're going add a distribution。Again， we're going to do it per
    cell。60% to 80 per of the average is fine， but we want to make sure it's the sum
    of goal。 not the sum of sales。Click out of that again， remove the label。 and then
    we're going to use the fill below option。
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's going to fill up to 60% with this dark gray than up to 80% with a
    slightly lighter gray。Click， O， again now。We have the shading in there， but you'll
    notice that the bars are slightly thinner。 so we can do that just remove this
    size。 Mo that down a little bit。 And you'll see that each of our salespeople now
    has a darker shading up to 60% of their goal。
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这将填充到60%，使用这种深灰色，然后到80%用稍微浅一些的灰色。点击，哦，再次现在。我们在这里有了阴影，但你会注意到条形图稍微细了一些。所以我们可以去掉这个大小。稍微调小一点。你会看到每位销售人员现在都有一个到60%目标的深色阴影。
- en: And then this lighter shading up to 80% of their goal。 And then obviously。 a
    bar at 100% of their goal along with this blue line representing what they actually
    achieved。 So packing a ton of information about how people are doing relative
    to a particular goal into a very small space。 that about does it for this episode
    of tableau in two minutes。 If you have any questions。
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后这个较浅的阴影填充到他们目标的80%。显然，100%目标的条形图，以及这条代表他们实际达到的蓝线。因此，在一个非常小的空间内压缩了关于人们相对于特定目标表现的大量信息。这就是本期《Tableau
