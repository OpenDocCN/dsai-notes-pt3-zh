    a violin plot and you can create one by going violin plot and basically it is
    a combination of a box plot as well as a KdeE plot So let's say we want information
    pretty much exactly the same we're going to get day information and total build
    information and we're going to be pulling that from our tips data frame and let's
    also use H as well so that we can get data on men and women and this is what a
    violin plot looks like Now while a box plot is going to correspond to data points
    a violin plot uses the KdeE estimation of our data points to create these plots
    and another thing we can do here is you can come up and throw another option in
    called split and set it to true。

    to each other。 So kind of useful。 And like I said， it's just going to depend on
    your type of data to for you to find which plot is going to work best for you。
    And next， I want to talk about a strip plots。 And then I'm going to get more into
    some styling options with。
