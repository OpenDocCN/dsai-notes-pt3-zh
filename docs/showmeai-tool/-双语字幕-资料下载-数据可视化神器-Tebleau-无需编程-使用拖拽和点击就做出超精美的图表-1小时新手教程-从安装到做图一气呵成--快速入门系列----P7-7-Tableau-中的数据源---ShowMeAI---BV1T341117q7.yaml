- en: We utilized the data source page when we created a tableau data source connection。Let's
    look at the other features that it offers， which can help us modify data and prepare
    it for visualization。First， let's look at the connection section on the upper
    left。The database section lists the current files or databases that you have connected
    to Tableau under the specific data source。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This list the title of the data source and the type of data connection。The first
    data source that you add will be tagged with the color blue。 Notice that if we
    add a second data connection to it。The new connection will have a different colored
    tag。This is done in order to easily identify and differentiate each individual
    connection。You can also observe the color scheme applied on the data preview and
    metadata grid。 wherein the selected sheets or tables from different connections
    will have different colored tags。Adding a new data connection using the add button
    of the connection section like what we demonstrated earlier。

    a second one which can be joined or related to the first connection that you have
    linked。 If you wanted to replace one of the connection。 Nagate to the connection
    you wanted to replace or edit。 then click its droprop down button。Select Edit
    connection in the menu。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To open the file B or database connection menu where you can select the new
    connection。Do remember that the list of connections listed here does not represent
    all of the data sources available in a workbook。 This is only for the sheet 1
    data source， as reflected by the data source name on the canvas。 A data source
    can always contain one or more data connections。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can have a new data source connections separate from this one。 by clicking
    the cylinder icon in the upper left and selecting new data source on the list。![](img/e14006b5774d29e879d86f51f29da096_1.png)
  prefs: []

    by Tableau。![](img/e14006b5774d29e879d86f51f29da096_3.png)

- en: If you wish to remove a created data source， make sure that the source is currently
    selected。 as indicated on the data source name on the canvasva。 then navigate
    to the data menu on the ribbon and select the closed data source。Aside from the
    data source name， we also have the connection type in the upper right of the canvas
    using the radio buttons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can choose to either use or an extract connection to your data source。 By
    default。 Tableau sets the connection type to live。 A live connection means that
    it contains direct connection to the underlying data。 Live connections offer the
    convenience of real time updates。 which any changes in the data source automatically
    reflect in Tableau。

- en: But live connections also rely on the database for all queries。 Thus。 it is
    not always optimized for fast performance。Your data queries will only be as fast
    as the database itself。The workbook speed can also be affected by your network
    speed， traffic and any custom SequL。Complex workbooks with live connections can
    also stress some traditional databases。Extracts。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: on the other hand， are a snapshot of data optimized for aggregation and loaded
    into system memory to be quickly recalled for visualization。 When you use the
    extract connection type， Tableau creates a TDE or tableableau data extract file。When
    you create an extract from a local file such as a CSB or an Excel workbook。Or
    an on premise database， you're speeding up the workbook through optimization。
    As a result。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Tableau doesn't need the database to build a visualization。 Instead。 Tableau's
    in memorymory data engine queries the extract directly。Extracts tend to be much
    faster than live connections。 especially in more complex visualizations with large
    data sets， filters and calculations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Since an extract is embedded， you can use your data source even when offline。A
    drawback to this connection type is that the data needs to be refreshed to receive
    updates from the original data source。If your data structure also has too many
    rows and columns， extracts refresh can become slow。

- en: Selecting the extract connection type in the canvas will show two new buttons
    to edit and refresh the current extract。 Clicking on Edit opens a new window where
    you can set how the extract data will be stored。 Def filters， aggregate data，
    and choose rows to include in the extract。After the connection types is the section
    for adding filters。On your data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will reduce the amount of data in the data source based on the filters
    you have indicated Data source filters can be useful for restricting the data
    users can see when you publish a workbook or a data source。 when you publish a
    data source to Tau server， the data source and any associated files or extracts
    are moved into the server。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: As you publish a data source， you can define access permissions for downloading
    or modifying the data source。 and you can also choose the users and groups who
    can remotely issue queries through Tableaus server against that data source。 clicking
    the add button on the data source page will open a new window where you can add
    edit and remove the applied filters to the data source to add a new filter。 click
    the add button， then select a field to base the filter on Once you have selected
    a field。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can now indicate a filter value by selecting the available values from the
    list。 set a wild card， indicate a condition or filter by top records from a field
    or formula。Another neat feature on the data source page is the data interpreter。
    The data interpreter helps you clean data by detecting titles， footnotes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: empty cells and other extra columns slash rows to identify the actual fields
    and values in your dataset set。![](img/e14006b5774d29e879d86f51f29da096_9.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It can even detect additional tables and subts so that you can work with a subset
    of your data independently of the other data。 For example， here we have a CSB
    file where the field names are not identified by tableau。 Let's turn on the data
    interpreter by ticking the data interpreter checkbox above the sheet list and
    observe how it changed the data Up upon doing so。 the F1 to F5 columns have now
    been replaced with the proper field names that were formerly on the second row。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It also change the data type of the country name from a string into a geographic
    one to check all of the changes done by the data interpreter you can click on
    the review the results。 which will output an Excel file that lists the changes
    using the original copy of data with color coded cells。

    It will not be shown in the data source page if the data is already in a proper
    format that Baau can interpret。 It has too many rows and columns， files that have
    more than 2000 columns or more than 3000 rows will not be processed by the data

- en: If the modifications done by the data interpreter was not enough。 you can always
    apply basic data formatting using the functions in the data pane。 For example。
    let's continue using the CSV file that we cleaned via data interpreter Since the
    columns are in a wide format。 we need to pivot the data in a way that it will
    indicate the year in one column and the numeric value on another to make it suitable
    for visualization。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To do so， select the fields that will be pivoted。 In this case。 we will select
    2001 up to column 2004。 Click on 2001 and hold the shift key on your keyboard。
    Then click the 2004 column to select the three columns。Then right click on your
    mouse and select pivott in the menu。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This will create two new columns using the selected data。 which will have the
    field names as pivot field names and pivot field values。Now。 you only need to
    rename them to rename a column， select one and click its drop down button。 select
    the Rename function， Then type in the new column name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also rename a field by simply double clicking its name and typing in
    a new field name。If you wish to bring back the original file names， click the
    drop down for the column and select Reset name。Aside from the rename function，
    you can also apply a sort。 hover over a specific fields name until the sort button
    appears on its right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Clicking on the sort button once will sort the data in ascending order as indicated
    by the icon。Clicking the sort again will sort it to ascending， descending order。Click
    the sort button for the third time， will'll remove the sort。As we have discussed
    in an earlier lesson， Tableau automatically assigns data types to the data based
    on a collection of commonly used patterns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These data types are seen on both the data pane and the metadata view in the
    form of icons to change the data type of a field。 click on the data type icon
    and select the new data type from the menu。Proper data types should always be
    observed as it will dictate which visualizations， calculations。 and functions
    can be applied to the field。You can also split a field into separate columns using
    the function on the data plane。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Click the drop down of the concatenated field and select the split function。By
    default。 Tableau splits it into two columns using space as the delimiter。If you
    want to specify a symbol as delimiter， you can use the custom split function in
    the fields drop down。 select the custom split function。 This will open a new window
    where you can indicate a specific separator or delimiter and the number of columns
    that will be split off from either the first last or throughout the column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Finally， we have the alias function。 An alias is an alternate name from members
    in a dimension so that their labels appear differently in the view。 to create
    an alias。 select the field and click on its drop down in the menu。 select aliases
    This will show a new window which lists all of the members or values available
    on the selected field to create the alias rename the alias under the value column。
    This way， Tableau will use the alias name as the value visible in the charts label。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you can still see its original value on the data plane。😊。Do take note that
    aliases are only created for discrete dimensions。 since those types of data have
    limited values。 This function is not available for continuous fields and measure。The
    basic formatting functions that we have learned are all done inside Tableau。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: None of them are applied to the original data source。The database section lists
    the current files or databases that you have connected to Tableau under the specific
    data source。This lists the title of the data source and the type of data connection。The
    first data source that you add will be tagged with the color blue。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: noticeice that if we add a second data connection to it。 the new connection
    will have a different colored tag。This is done in order to easily identify and
    differentiate each individual connection。You can also observe the color scheme
    applied on the data preview and metadata grid。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: wherein the selected sheets or tables from different connections will have different
    colored tags。Adding a new data connection using the add button of the connection
    section will not replace the current data connection on the list Instead it will
    insert a second one which can be joined or related to the first connection that
    you have linked if you wanted to replace one of the connections。
