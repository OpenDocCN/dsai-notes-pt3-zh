- en: In this short Excel tutorial， I want to show you how to create your own Excel
    templates。 And just so that you can see right away what I'm talking about。 let
    me show you what I mean Here I am in Excel in the info section。![](img/d3f5b5c9fc5ee2f04a826197a1bf2331_1.png)

- en: And I'm just gonna go click on new。 So I click on new。 and it takes me to a
    page where I can create a completely blank workbook。 or I could open up one of
    these premade templates that other people have made and that Excel is making available
    to me so that I can easily just click to open up one of these templates。 And there's
    all sorts of templates that I can open up and use， And for the most part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: they are wonderful。 But in addition to these。 notice what else I have。 I have
    a button here that says personal， And when I click on that。 I can get personal
    templates that I have made。 No one else can see these just me。 but I can click
    on these and open up quickly an Excel template that I can then adapt for my own
    needs and for my own uses。

- en: So let's look at how I did this。 How did I save this particular spreadsheet
    to be a personal template。 Well， to show you this， I'm going open up a spreadsheet
    that I've been working on。 This is a monthly family。😊，Budt that I'd like to use
    for my family。 And I actually found this online。 And I've gone in and changed
    some of the categories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of the expenses and things like that that they had in here。 Most of these
    are relevant to me。 but there are a few that don't necessarily apply to me and
    my family。 and so I went in and change them。 So anyway， now that I've made a few
    changes here。 I want to save this so that on a monthly basis， I can just open
    up the template and start putting in the numbers for that month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And because it's a template， there won't be any danger of me over writing the
    last month's budget。 Okay， so to save this as a template。 What I need to do is
    go up to file。 choose save as And I'm going save this to this PC。 So I'll double
    click on that this PC。 it opened up a window here that I can use to look at my
    computer， the contents of my computer。

- en: In this case， my documents。 But I want to save this not as a typical Excel workbook。As
    an Excel template。 So I'm gonna select template。 and upon doing that。 notice that
    it opened up a folder that I wasn't aware of， or I hadn't even selected really。
    it just automatically opened it up。 and I can see up here at the top what it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's in documents and it's called custom office template。 There's a folder called
    that。 And I just have one template in there right now。 But because I changed this
    save as type to be Excel template。 It automatically opened up this particular
    folder。 Now I can name this template family budget planner1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to change that probably and just call it family budget。 and maybe I should
    put the word template in there。 So family budget template。 I'll click save。 And
    so now I'm gonna X out of this。 And let's pretend like a few days later， I go
    into Excel。 I open it up。 and I would like to make a new monthly budget for this
    upcoming month。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't have to open up last month and then change。The dates and change all
    the numbers and delete out the numbers that were there from last month。 Instead，
    I just open up Excel。 I go in and choose personal。 and there it is family budget
    template and I double click on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It opens up everything is blank and now I can go in and click or double click
    and type in the next month in there。 and then I can start putting in the numbers
    that apply。 and I can change。 let's say the extra income for the month or whatever
    it might be。 But this way there's no need to open up last month and then delete
    all the numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: change everything。 This will save you a lot of time a lot of work。 and one of
    the nicest things about it is you're not going to accidentally click save and
    erase last month。 let's say you opened up October's spreadsheet， change the numbers
    in preparation to do November family budget and then you accidentally click save。
    It's gonna erase October's spreadsheet and over write。So using a template solves
    that problem。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're not going to accidentally overwrite last month's work。 Okay so let's
    pretend like I've put in all the numbers and this budget is done。 I'm gonna go
    up to file， save as this PC this time I'm not saving it as a template I'm just
    saving it as a workbook and all I have to do is take out the word template。 family
    budget November 2017 and click save And then just to reiterate next month I can
    go in。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: click personal， open up family budget again and it's the blank version of the
    budget again and this time I'll put in December so hopefully you get the idea
    and you see the advantage to doing it this way to using Excel template to create
    content that you need to generate on a monthly basis or maybe a quarterly basis
    or even a yearly basis but you don't want to have to recreate the will each time
    you want the template available in a partially blank format。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The numbers are zeroed out many of them。 and then you can just build from there
    for the current month or quarter or year。 So I hope you enjoyed watching this
