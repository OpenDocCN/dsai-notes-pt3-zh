- en: In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to retrieve rows that match a specific
    string pattern。 For example， let's say we only want to get the customers whose
    last name start with B。 So here in the word clause。😊，We type out where last name。This
    is where we use the like operator。 and right after that we add a string pattern。
    So we want to get the customers whose last name start with B and we have any number
    of characters after B。
  id: totrans-2
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we use the percent sign to indicate any number of characters。 you might have
    one character after B or no characters or 10 characters with this pattern we get
    all the customers whose last name start with B。 And also it doesn't matter if
    it's an uppercase or a lowercase B So let's execute this query there you go。 So
    we only have three customers whose last name start with B。😊，As another example。
  id: totrans-3
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say we only want to get the customers whose last name start with brush。
    so we change our pattern to brush percent。 Now let's execute the query。 we only
    get this one customer here。Now， this percent sign doesn't have to be at the end
    of the pattern。 It cant be anywhere。 For example， let's say we want to search
    for customers who have a B in their last name。
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: whether it's at the beginning in the middle or at the end。 So we change our
    pattern to percent B percent。 This pattern means we can have any number of characters
    before or after B。 Let's execute the query。These are the customers who have a
    be somewhere and their last name。 it doesn't matter if B is at the beginning or
    in the middle or at the end。
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look at another example。I want to get all the customers whose last name
    and with why。😊。So here's the pattern we use， let's execute this query and we have
    five customers whose last name ands with a why。So this is how we use the percent
    sign。 Now we also have an underscore and that matches a single character。 So with
    this pattern we get customers whose last name is exactly two characters long。
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't care what the first character is， but the second character should be
    y let's execute the query。 obviously we don't have any customers whose last name
    matches this pattern。 but if you change this pattern to five underscores， So one，2，3，4，5。😊，Followed
    by a why。We should get these customers， so their last name is exactly six characters。
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We don't care about the first five characters， but all of them end with a why。Now。
    as another example， we can replace the first underscore with B。 and that means
    we want to get the customers whose last name start with B and after B we have
    exactly four characters followed by a Y let's execute this query。 so we only have
    one customer that matches this pattern。😊，So this is how we use the like operator。
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We use the percent sign to represent any number of characters。And。😊。An underscore
    to represent a single character。Now this like operator in MyQl is an older operator。
    but we also have a newer one that is more powerful and it allows us to search
    for any string patterns。 and that's what I'm going to show you next。😊。
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们使用百分号来表示任意数量的字符。并且。😊 一个下划线来表示单个字符。现在这个like运算符在MySQL中是一个较旧的运算符。但我们还有一个更新的运算符，它更强大，可以让我们搜索任何字符串模式。这就是我接下来要向你展示的内容。😊

- en: Al right here I'm going to give you two exercises for the like operator first。
    I want you to get the customers whose addresses contain trail or avenue。 and next
    I want you to get the customers whose phone numbers and with9。😊。![](img/987f1c63e9084fb804d511337ab2db5a_5.png)
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 好的，这里我将给你两个关于like运算符的练习。首先，我想让你找到地址包含“trail”或“avenue”的客户。接下来，我想让你找到电话号码以9结尾的客户。😊

  zh: '![](img/987f1c63e9084fb804d511337ab2db5a_6.png)'
- en: Al right， let's get started with the first exercise。 so select star from customers
    where address like like here we want to use a search pattern like this。😊，We want
    to have trail， but trail can be anywhere in the address。 so we put a percent before
    and after Tra。Next， we should use the or operator to search for another pattern。
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 好的，让我们开始第一个练习。所以从customers表中选择所有记录，条件是地址像这样搜索。😊 我们想要“trail”，但“trail”可以出现在地址的任何地方。因此我们在“trail”前后都放一个百分号。接下来，我们应该使用or运算符来搜索另一个模式。
- en: Or address， like， let me put this on a new line that is better address like
    once again。 percent Avenue percent。That's it。So let's execute this query。😊。Here
    is the result you should get the customers with IDs 2， 9 and 10 if you look at
    their addresses。 all of them have either Trail or avenue in their address。Now
    let's work on the second exercise。
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 或者地址像，让我把这放到新的一行，这样更好。地址像，再次使用百分号“avenue”百分号。就这样。所以让我们执行这个查询。😊 这里是你应该得到的结果，ID为2、9和10的客户，如果你查看他们的地址，他们的地址中都有“trail”或“avenue”。现在让我们开始第二个练习。
- en: We want to get the customers whose phone numbers and with night。 that is pretty
    easy so let me change our work clause。😊，Where phone， once again。 we use the likeU
    operator at a percent followed by a nine， that's all you had to do。😊。Let's execute
    the query， So here's the result， customers with IDs 3 and 7。
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我们想找电话号码以9结尾的客户。这非常简单，所以让我修改我们的工作条件。😊，在电话号码那一栏，我们再次使用like运算符，后面跟一个百分号和9，这就是你需要做的。😊
    让我们执行这个查询。结果是，ID为3和7的客户。
- en: their phone numbers and with 9。So this is how we use the like operator and by
    the way you can always use the not operator here。 let's say if you want to get
    the customers whose phone numbers don't end with9。 so we simply prefix like with
    not Now if we execute this query one more time we get all the other customers
    and the database。😊。
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 他们的电话号码以9结尾。所以这就是我们如何使用like运算符，顺便说一下，你可以在这里始终使用not运算符。假设你想找电话号码不以9结尾的客户。那么我们只需在like前加上not。现在如果我们再执行一次这个查询，我们会得到数据库中的所有其他客户。😊
