- en: In this Excel tutorial， I'm going show you how to make lightning fast Excel
    charts with the method I'm going to show。 you don't have to stress。 You don't
    have to worry。 You don't have to think about it too much。 You basically just do
    a couple things。 and then type a keyboard shortcut， and you get a chart。 So let's
    look at how to do that。 here we have some data on board game and card game sales。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see a list of fun games here。 And then each month of the year。 and how
    many were sold of each per month。 The first thing I need to do before adding my
    lightning fast Excel chart is I need to highlight the data。 And by the data， I
    mean， the data that's important in a chart。 So this title of game sales。 I probably
    don't need that。 I do need the titles of the games， though。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm gonna to click here where it says product name。 and I'll click and drag
    down and across。 Now。 I'm not going to include the totals， Neither these at the
    bottom nor the ones on the right。 Tos can just mess up charts completely and make
    them kind of nonsensical。 So that's the data that I really care about。For my chart，
    next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just type the following keyboard shortcut alt F1。 So I hold alt on the keyboard
    and then just tap the F1 key。 and that produces an Excel chart showing your data。
    Now。 it didn't really give me an option for choosing a chart type。 It simply picked
    whatever my default chart type is。 And you can change that in the Excel settings。
    if you'd like。 As you can see， I've clicked and drag the corners to make it bigger
    so that you can see this wonderful chart that I created with just two steps。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Each month is listed， and each type of game is represented with a different
    colored bar。 So I can see that in January， the game code names did particularly
    well。 in December。 looks like boggle was the most often sold game。 Now。 if you
    don't like the chart type that was picked。 All you have to do is go here to the
    chart design tab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because I now have a chart in my spreadsheet and it selected。 I have a chart
    design tab and。Also a format tab。 And I can use these to format and change my
    chart。 Let's look at just a couple of the options that you might need when you're
    making these lightning fast Excel charts in chart design。 you might choose to
    change the chart type away from the default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is my default clustered column。 I might change it to stacked column
    and click O。 So you can see the difference there。 This way， I can see that January
    and December were my best months for selling games overall。 but I can also glance
    and see which games sold the most each month code names here boggled there。 and
    the color codes correspond to these labels down here。 So this chart type really
    might be better。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could click again and change to， let's say a 3D stacked column chart。 That
    looks pretty cool。 There it is。 And if I really want to get complicated with it。
    I could switch to the 3D column chart。 For me， this is a little hard to read and
    understand some。But pretty cool。 So I'm gonna go back to the stacked column chart。
    Now， just so you know。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you want a different chart type to become your default。 all you have to do
    is right click on it and choose set as default chart。 Allright。 so I'm going to
    click okay and there's my chart。 Another option or two that you might want to
    know about that you can find here on the chart design tab and ribbon include things
    like changing the chart style。 that looks pretty cool changing it to that style。
    And there's just a whole range of styles here that you can choose from for your
    lightning fast chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also click here to change the colors。 you can go monochromatic。 you
    can change to orange or whatever you want to do。 I'm going undo those。 And in
    addition to the chart design options there are some format options as well。 you
    can make these subtle changes to the chart as well using the format tab。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going delete the chart。 despite how beautiful it looks。 just so I can show
    you that there's another keyboard shortcut。YouW to create a chart based on the
    data that you have here。 but you want to put the chart on another sheet to do
    that again， you just select your data。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: watch what happens if I don't select the data。 if I just click somewhere inside
    the data like here and I'm just going to do the same alt F1 one more time。 you
    can see what it does， it still creates the chart even though I didn't click and
    drag to select all of the data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it still created the chart， but it included my totals。 So that's why the first
    thing you need to do is click and drag to select your data。 But if you have a
    spreadsheet that doesn't have totals。 let's say you have a giant spreadsheet and
    you don't want to have to click and drag to get all of the columns and all of
    the rows。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some shortcuts that can help you do that anyway。 but if you don't
    want to bother with that just make sure you don't have totals above or below and
    then just click somewhere inside your data In this case。 though， I'm just going
    click and drag to select the data that's important。 And this time because I want
    the chart to appear not on this spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But on a new additional sheet， all I have to do in this case is tap just the
    F 11 key。 And you can see it's added a new sheet for me here。 Now。 the chart looks
    a little funny to me this time。 And so again。 I might go to change chart type
    to switch it up to another layout to another look And then just click So in summary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all you have to do to create a lightning fast Excel chart is select your data
    and then press alt F1 to create a chart on the current sheet。 If you don't want
    it on the current sheet， just select the important data and tap the F11 key and
    it'll put it on a separate new sheet。
