Alright， let's go ahead and move on。 We've just got a couple more things to do inside the notebook。

 And then we're going to do a tour of the other things you can do in Jupyter notebooks outside of the notebook。

 And then I've got some extensions to show you。 and then we'll be done。

 So we're getting pretty close here， so。

Alright， so running bash or terminal。

Commands here。So a nice thing about Jupiter notebooks， Jupiter notebooks。

Is that even though we're running Python here。Jupiter Notes allows you to run bash commands。

 so for example。Even though this LS。Is a bash command， It doesn't require this special syntax。

 which I'm about to show you。Which is the exclamation point。 So typically。

 if you're running normal bash or terminal commands。

 you're going to use this exclamation point to tell Jupyter notebooks that you want to run a bash command。

 So let's say we want to make a directory。 So we' want to make their。Just， you know， test directory。

 something like that。

Now if I run LS。

![](img/bf0b1fbde882381507b11138c74d9d67_8.png)

You'll see that we've just created a new test directory。

 And if I come back out here to our Jupyter notebooks， our main window。

 you'll see that here is our test directory。 So we were able to run a batchsh command inside of Jupyter notebooks。

 You can also do this if you need to install a new package， for example。

 like let's say you want to Pip install the data visualization library， Cborn。 Well。

 you could do that right within the Jupyter notebook if you wanted。😊。

Although you could also just hop back out to the terminal to do that。 So， you know， you don't。

 you don't need to do this in here necessarily， but。

And there you go。
