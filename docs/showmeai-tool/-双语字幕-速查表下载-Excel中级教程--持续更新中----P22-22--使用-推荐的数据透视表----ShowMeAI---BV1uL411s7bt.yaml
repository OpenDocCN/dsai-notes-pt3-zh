- en: In this short tutorialÔºå I'm going to show you the easiest„ÄÇ simplest way to add
    pivot tables to your Excel spreadsheets„ÄÇ And this feature is called recommended
    pivot tables„ÄÇ And it's only available in the more recent versions of Excel„ÄÇ So
    you'll have to check to see if your version of Excel has it„ÄÇ And the place to
    go to check is here in the upper left corner„ÄÇ just click on insert and you should
    see next to pivot table„ÄÇ you should see recommended pivot tables„ÄÇ NowÔºå if you
    haven't already done so„ÄÇ

- en: you really should watch my previous video that focused just on regular pivot
    tables„ÄÇ and how to set them up how to arrange it to get the data that you want
    to show up using pivot tables„ÄÇ So please watch that video before you watch this
    oneÔºå or at least in addition to watching this one„ÄÇ And in that previous videoÔºå
    I used this same spreadsheet with a list of bands and the spreadsheet is supposed
    to be an inventory for a hypothetical synth pop music store„ÄÇ

- en: And so we've got a list here of some amazing„ÄÇüòäÔºåPop bands and their most recent
    C releases„ÄÇ and it's arranged in a way that's pretty typical for an inventory„ÄÇ
    You've got an item number„ÄÇ you've got the price„ÄÇ you've got fourquarter of the
    year„ÄÇ you've got total copy sold and the total sales In other wordsÔºå the total
    amount of money brought in„ÄÇ

- en: but if I wanted to pull out specific data from this spreadsheet and look at
    it in a new way I could use the pivot table tool to do that but next to the pivot
    table tool„ÄÇ there's something called recommended pivot tables and this is the
    easiest way to do it if you just click on recommended pivot tables you get a popup
    and I'm going to see if I can stretch that out a little bit„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and recommended pivot tables is just what it sounds like„ÄÇ Excel here is recommending
    based on the data that I have in the spreadsheet„ÄÇ It's recommending possible pivot
    tables to me so I could have a pivot table report of the sum of price by genre„ÄÇ
    And so this would help me to know for each genre that I sell in my store„ÄÇ what
    the price is„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but is that really what I want to know„ÄÇmeanÔºå this is the sum of the price of
    the items that might be sold„ÄÇ but they haven't necessarily been sold yet„ÄÇ And
    so I don't know if that's really what I want„ÄÇ I don't think it is so I'm gonna
    click down here on some of sales by genre Now this might be more useful to me
    Now I can look and identify which genre of music that I sell in my hypothetical
    store performs best with my customers and my hypothetical customers have amazing
    taste in music and so you can see Sth pop that's the one that's generating the
    most sales for me So that recommended pivot table might actually be a useful pivot
    table for me next there's some of item number and some of copies sold and some
    of quarter by genre for me this isn't that helpful I don't really need to know
    the item number and you know maybe the sum of copies sold that would be useful
    but I don't like that one so I'm gonna go down and pick the next one so the idea
    is that you can just go down and select one of these recommended pivot tables
    Excel„ÄÇ

- en: Has already done the work for you Basically you're just looking at it to see
    oh„ÄÇ is that useful to me or is it not useful to me„ÄÇ Here's some of copies sold
    by band„ÄÇ That's pretty usefulÔºå I think it also lists the genre that goes with
    that band So that could be pretty useful and then the sum of quarter by band„ÄÇ
    So it's adding up the quarters notice that they all come to the same number except
    for brandon flowers„ÄÇ

- en: because I only put his Cd in for one quarter„ÄÇ So this is another example of
    a pivot table report„ÄÇ even though it's recommended it's pretty useless„ÄÇ it's not
    really telling me information that I want or need„ÄÇ So in this case for this exampleÔºå
    I'm just gonna pick some of copies sold by band„ÄÇ I click on it„ÄÇ click okay and
    notice what it didÔºå it added a sheet for me where I can see this pivot table report
    and I can glean the information from it that I want If I want to tweak this report„ÄÇ

- en: if I want to maybe add to it or change it in some way over here in the rightÔºå
    I have„ÄÇPivt table Field panel and I could adjust it I could add quarter in as
    a column or do any number of changes and if you're interested in learning more
    about how this works watch my previous video called advanced Excel introduction
    to pivot tables so I really like pivot tables and most often I do just make them
    myself I just use insert pivot table that's what I do most often because I usually
    know exactly what I want in my pivot table report but other times I'm not exactly
    sure and so I do insert recommended pivot tables and then I just look and see
    oh I wonder if this would be helpful to me I wonder if that piece of information
    would be helpful to me and so it's a great way to get ideas about how a pivot
    table might benefit you and draw out information about your data So thanks for
    watching I hope you found this video to be helpful if you did please click the
