- en: Hi folks， welcome to another episode of Tableau in two minutes today we're going
    to be covering how to blend data within Tableau so I've gone ahead and connected
    to my fictional furniture sales data that I cooked up for these data demonstrations
    and I've gone ahead and just unioned all of the sales tables together so September
    October November December and you can see the sales that we have in our data source
    down here the other pieces that we have in this database as it were it's not really
    a database it's really an Excel sheet but close enough is a table with our regional
    leaders。
  prefs: []

- en: our product leaders and the unit cost each of those is an individual table now
    you'll remember if you've seen the data joins in the data source video that we
    did actually join all of those together in this particular data source that we
    had a big like tree of tables sitting out here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，We're not going to do that this time。 we're going to use data blending to
    achieve something that's very similar。 So we'll go ahead and hop over to sheet
    one and you can see that we just have our sales sheets in our sales fields rather
    in this data source So the first thing we need to do is we need to add a new data
    source we're going to go ahead and reconnect to this Excel file It's called furniture
    sales right here and then we're going to drag our regional leaders out and the
    first one we're going to join is the regional you can see we have regional and
    then regional sales director and then east and west or our two regions we'll hop
    back over to our main sheet here。

- en: And you can see that now we have two data sources instead of having just one
    so why don't we go ahead and drag region out here you can see we have region west
    and we'll just drag sales out onto the column here and what we want to do is we
    want to add the regional leader to the sheet now the first thing we want to do
    is go up to here and go edit relationships now you'll see that our primary data
    source which is the sales table has a relationship set up automatically between
    the two region field so you'll remember we had a region field in our sales table
    we have a regional field in our regional leaders table and both those have automatically
    been assigned a relationship because they have the same name so when we click
    on regionals here you'll see we have this little orange link highlighted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，If we were to uncheck that， then there will be no relationship between the
    data sources and you can see that because the little link has gone gray and it
    has a line through it if it's orange and connected then there is a link so that
    means we can use fields from this data source in our visualization so let's go
    ahead and drag regional sales director out here next to region and you'll see
    that we get regional and regional sales director in the same sheet Now what happens
    if we wanted to add some information about our product let's go ahead and jump
    to a new sheet here we're going to add our product leaders So again we're just
    going to reconnect to this Excel file's furniture sales open it up drag our product
    leaders out and you can see we have a field called product name which is the product
    and then we have the product leader。

    Let's go back to sheet2。😊。![](img/c26f286988d064f338838c944f67e4e9_10.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then we'll go up again。 we just want to drag out， so let's go ahead and start
    with the sales table。 We'll drag out product。And then again， just go ahead and
    drag out sales right here and then you can see right that we've got our products
    and we've got a total sales Now what happens if we want to drag out the product
    leader as well Well if we go up to product leaders you'll see there's no established
    relationship here that's because product name doesn't match any of the fields
    in here it's just called product So to fix that we're going to go up to edit relationships。

- en: Under the data menu instead of leaving this as automatic， you can see there's
    nothing listed in here。 we're going to click custom we're going click add a relationship
    and then we're going to select product from the primary data source product name
    from the secondary data source and go ahead and create that relationship click
    okay now when we go up and click on our product leader data so yeah our product
    leader data source you'll see the product name has the little link again we can
    check and uncheck that depending on whether we want to include or break the link
    and then we can drag product name across next to our。

- en: Oh， product leaders real helpful。 product leader。 There we go。 And now it's
    joined up all of the product leaders with the products in our main data source。
    Now there's one more thing to remember。 And that comes when you use continuous
    fields。 So let's go ahead and create again， we're going create a new data source。
    This time。

- en: Unit cost table。 so we're going to drag the unit across here we have a product
    name and a per unit cost。![](img/c26f286988d064f338838c944f67e4e9_22.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's go back to sheet 3 again， because we have product name in one data
    source and product in another。 we're going to have to go up to， we want to use，
    this is our sales data source。 We want to use that as the primary one。 And then
    we want to go to unit cost。 You'll see there's no relationship。 So you gonna have
    to go ahead and define a custom one。

- en: So product and product name。 Alright， so let's do this。 We're going to drag
    product out from here。 We're going to drag。Units out from here。And then we're
    going to drag unit cost out。From here per unit cost。 Okay， so now we have our
    table set up。 We have the per unit cost。 we have the number of units we sold。
    Now， if we wanted to find out what the total was。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we would just want to multiply these together，436 times 60。So we can do that
    by creating a calculated field。 Now。 you'll notice I'm creating this calc field
    in my unit cost data set。 So that means。😊。So this is going to be total cost so
    that means that when I create this field。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's going to show up under the unit cost data at anything that is a unit cost
    from this unit cost data。 any fields from here that we use specifically per unit
    cost we can use those unaggregated so I don't have to put these as a sum min Max
    etc etc etc but you'll see here when I try and add something from the sales data
    so in this case we're going to add units。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So when I add this， you'll see it automatically aggregates it for me。 and
    I can't mix aggregate and non aggregate functions。😊，I also can't take away this
    sum。And have them be row level calculations you see because it'll say all fields
    must be aggregated constant when using table calculation functions or fields from
    multiple data sources。😊，And what that means is that because these are at a different
    detail level。😊。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They don't have a one to one relationship in the data source and when blending
    we have to summarize both data sources and we can only combine them in calculations
    at the summary level so we couldn't have for example。 a unit cost right where
    we just looked at the number of units per thing and then we we。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Subtracted them out line by line in our data source。 we have to aggregate them
    first and then do the calculation aggregate level。 but it does work so we've got
    total cost。 Now we can drag that out。 You'll see that。 We have total cost。Out
    here， which is just the units times the per unit calculation and we did those
    by summing them both up and this you'll see is Ag。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so it's an aggregate calculation。 you'll also see that the two calculations
    that we have from our secondary data source。 the unit cost data source have this
    little check mark next to them。😊。Indicating that they're from a secondary data
    source。So that is a good way to tell whether you have things set up the right
    way around depending on how you do this you may want to organize it so that all
    of your calculations are done under one particular data source sometimes I like
    to make sure that everything's done under the primary data source but sometimes
    that's not always practical so this is a good way to fix that right that about
    wraps it up for this episode of Tableau in two minutes on data blending if you
    have any questions please leave them in the comments you can download the data
    and the Tableau workbook from the video description if you like what you're hear
    and you'd like more tableableau tips and tricks then please subscribe to our channel
