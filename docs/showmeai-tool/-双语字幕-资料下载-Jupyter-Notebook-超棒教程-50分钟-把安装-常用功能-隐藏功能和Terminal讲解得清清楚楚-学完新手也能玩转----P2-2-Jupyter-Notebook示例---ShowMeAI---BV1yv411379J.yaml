- en: I am going to drag over here。 I have a， this is a a Github repository here。
    a gallery of interesting Jupyter notebooks。 So if you're interested in asking
    the question。 what all are Jupyter notebooks used for。 Well， the answer is they're
    used for about anything that you might want to do with data and Python。 So specifically
    this this person， or I guess this has probably been compiled by a lot of different
    people。

    let's see。 We've got some general Python programming， scientific computing。 I'm
    going to scroll down to where are we Ma learning， statistics and probability。
    Let's take a look。

    faces in the wild dataset set。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_10.png)

- en: You'll see here that using this nice little inB viewer URL。 we're able to see
    this person's Jupyter notebook and see exactly the code that they used。 see exactly
    what they did。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_12.png)

    using。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_15.png)

- en: And you can use normal text here to divide it up into section。 So this is why
    this is why Jupyter notebooks have become more and more popular within the scientific
    community and also for data scientists。 generally speaking， is because you're
    able to in a single notebook。 do some experiments you're able to do some modeling。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you're able to you're able to do you know whatever kind of transformations and
    manipulations with your data that you want and and train a model that does that
    does predictions。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_17.png)

    with others。 So it's， it's a really great way。😊。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_23.png)

- en: To make your work more visible to others more transparent。 And， you know。 you
    can share this notebook with anybody。 They don't have to be technically minded。
    they don't。 you don't have to create a web application or anything you don't have
    to create a whole website to just share some analysis that you wanted to do。 So
    Jupiter notebooks are very handy for a lot of different things And I'm not sure
    what you want to use them for。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I'm sure it's very interesting and useful。 So let me show you how to use
    Jupiter notebooks。 Let's go ahead and dive。![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_25.png)
