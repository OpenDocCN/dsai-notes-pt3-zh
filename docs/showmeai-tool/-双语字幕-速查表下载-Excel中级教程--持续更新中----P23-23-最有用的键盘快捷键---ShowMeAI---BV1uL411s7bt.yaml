- en: This Excel tutorial covers the most useful keyboard shortcuts in Microsoft Excel。
    And I want to start with two really common keyboard shortcuts。 These are usable
    in almost every program， but I still think they're important and useful for you
    to know。 The first is control S。 You hold the control key and tap the letter S。
    And when you do that。

- en: it saves your spreadsheet。 And so it's the equivalent of going up here and clicking
    the save button or clicking file and save。 Next， we have control P。 You hold control。
    you tap P。 That brings up the print options in Microsoft Excel。 And now you can
    just click the print button and print out your document。 Like I said。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: those are pretty commonplace， but I think if you don't know them， you need to
    know them。 Next。 we have control T。 And what control T does is it turns the selected
    cells into a table。 You can see that I already have a table here on the screen。
    This is a list of synth pop and new wave bands and they're most recently released。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Album and also their current price on Amazon com。 And you can see it's a table。
    You can tell that it's a table because it's formatted in a special way。 The colors
    alternate and things like that。 You can just tell that this data is meant to go
    together in this table。 and I can create a table like this， simply by holding
    control and tapping T。 So for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: over here on sheet number 3。 I'm gonna click here is the data that I would like
    to turn into a table。 All I have to do is click and drag to highlight the range
    that I would like to turn into a table。 I release the mouse。 And now I hold control
    and tap T Excel asks where's the data。 It seems to already know。 but if it happened
    to be wrong， I could change that。 My table has headers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Yes， it does by our amount spent date but if it didn't have headers， I could
    uncheck that。 and just click okay。 and look what it did。 It automatically turned
    that data into a table。 So control T。 a really useful tool that I use quite a
    bit。 Juing back to sheet1。 the rest of the Excel。Keyboard shortcuts that I'm going
    to show you have to do with getting around in your Excel spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in many cases， that is one of the hardest， most tedious parts of using Excel。
    I constantly have to navigate around the data in my spreadsheet。 so I'll need
    to go up to the top to make changes。 and then I need to go down to the bottom
    and this is a pretty small spreadsheet to be honest。 but if you had 2000 records，
    if you had 5000 or 10000 records in your spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: imagine having to jump around from the top of your spreadsheet to the bottom
    and vice versa And then also sometimes it can be hard to click and drag and select
    the right data。 if I wanted to select this entire row， sometimes that's kind of
    difficult and I might be inaccurate with how I do it same with a column if I wanted
    to select this whole column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes that's hard to do。 So let's take a look at some keyboard shortcuts
    that can make doing these tasks a lot easier and quicker。 And the first example
    is whenever you want to go to the top left corner of。Your data in a spreadsheet。
    simply use the keyboard shortcut control home。 So hold the control key。 tap home
    and look what it did。 It took me up to the top of my data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but not only that it actually went to the upper left corner。 So that cell is
    actually highlighted cell a2 in this case。 because that's where the data begins。
    So control plus home is very useful。 Let's look at the opposite example。 A lot
    of times you need to get to the bottom of your data to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you hold control and tap the end key。And notice what that did。 That took me
    to the lower right corner of my data in the spreadsheet。 Now。 I'm going to tap
    control home again to show you yet another way to get down to the bottom of the
    data。 But this one is a little bit different。 And that is hold control and tap
    the down arrow on your keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you do that， it takes you down to the very bottom of your data。 But notice
    that instead of being at the lower right。 It just took me to the very bottom record。
    And because I was already in column a， it took me to a 46 in this case。 But let's
    try it again。 I'm going to go control home to get back up to the top。 Let's say
    I'm in cell E 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I hold control and tap the down arrow。 Not what it did。 it just took me
    to the very bottom record。 It didn't move me to the left or to the right。 But
    rather， I stayed in the same column。 This next keyboard shortcut。 It't have to
    do with moving around inside the sheet。 But rather from one sheet to another。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So right now， I'm in sheet one， and I have these all out of order That。Okay，
    but sheet1。 it's actually the third sheet listed。 If I would like to go to sheet
    3。 all I have to do is click on it。 if I want to go to sheet 2。 I just click on
    that and back to sheet 1 but really one of the main purposes of keyboard shortcuts
    is to keep your hands on the keyboard Anytime you have to take your hands off
    the keyboard to use the mouse or to do anything else for that matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are now less efficient to using Excel。 And so that's why we have keyboard
    shortcuts to keep our hands on the keyboard so we can do the work we need to do。
    So instead of using the mouse to click on sheet3 or sheet 2。 all I have to do
    is hold the control key and tap the page up key and look what happened。 it moved
    me back to this sheet if I tap it again control page up it moves me back to the
    previous sheet before that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about the opposite case。 If you want to move to the right to the next sheet。
    you hold control and tap page down and then page down again and I'm back where
    I started So those last few keyboard shortcuts。 I think you'll find them to be。Useful
    and pretty helpful in navigating around your spreadsheet and quickly getting to
    the top or the bottom or to a different sheet。 This next keyboard shortcut is
    kind of fun to do and kind of interesting。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I don't use it that often to be honest with you。 But what it is is control
    D。 And you use control D to copy an item down。 So， for example。 each of these
    amazing synth pop or new wave bands has more than one Cd listed in this spreadsheet。
    except for Brandon flowers。 But he has had other releases besides the amazing
    Cd。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the desired effect that came out a year or two ago。 So if I would like to add
    more entries for Brandon flowers。 I could click on that cell。 copy and paste it，
    or I could click on it and use the autofill handle to just fill it in like that。
    But instead， I'm going use control D。 And to do that， first。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to select what I want to copy Brandon flowers in this case。 and then
    drag down as far as I want it to be copied。 So I want it to go down to。60Then
    I just hold control T D。 And because I'm in a table， I'm getting this warning。
    but don't worry about that。 I just click OK and it added Brandon flowers several
    times to this spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So like I said， control plus D。 It's kind of fun。 I like to use it。 And I find
    it to be helpful。 but I don't use it that often。 So now let's look at the last
    three keyboard shortcuts that I'm going recommend that everybody learn。 And the
    last three， I'll deal with selecting data。 in Excel。 you have to select data often
    in order to copy and paste in order to change the font or the formatting or the
    alignment of the data in your spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's lots of examples and lots of times when you need to select data。 And
    of course。 you could do that the manual way you could just click and drag to highlight
    and select the text。 And that's a good way to do it。 And let's look at some shortcuts。
    If you've clicked on your spreadsheet。 you can hold control and tap a。 and it
    should select all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if you。In a table。 noticeice that it selects everything that's in the table。
    and it does not include any information that's outside the table。 However。 if
    I hold control and tap A again， then it does select everything。 So you can see
    that that's indeed what happened。 However， in this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just want to select the table。 So control A， selects just the table。 I'll
    use control C， which。 of course， is copy， And then I'll go to， let's say sheet
    2。 And I'm going to hold control and tap V for paste。 and it paste it in that
    table。 So control a selects everything， unless you're inside a table。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then it selects everything in the table， but nothing more。 But again。 you could
    do control A twice to then select everything。 All right， next up， we have control
    space。 and control space is for selecting an entire column。 Put the cursor wherever
    you want it to be。 hold control tap space。 The entire column is selected。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And then you can copy， paste it as needed， or change its font or alignment or
    whatever you need to do。 Finally， we have shift plus space。 This is our first
    time using shift instead of control。 But you hold shift， tap space， and it selects
    the entire row。 So I hope that you found these keyboard shortcuts to be useful。
    If you have。
