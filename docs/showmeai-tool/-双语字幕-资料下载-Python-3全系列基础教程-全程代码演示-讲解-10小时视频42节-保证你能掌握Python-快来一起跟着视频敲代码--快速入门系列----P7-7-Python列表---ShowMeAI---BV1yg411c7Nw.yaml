- en: Welcome back， everyone。 My name is Brian。 And in this video， we're going to
    cover lists。 A list is a complex data type compared to what we've been talking
    about。 It's very complex。 So far。 we've covered bulls， numbers and strings， but
    the list as well vastly more complex as we're about to see。 So first off， what
    is a list。😊。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: List or collection of data， and what do I mean by that？Imagine， we add an item。That
    item is going to be at position 0， meaning the first item you add is always 0。
    And as we add items。You guessed it。That index will increment。LetsGo ahead and
    add an item here。So01。2， and these items， they can be the same， they can be different，
    they can be something totally crazy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whatever we want to do。This is the beauty of Python。So the list doesn't have
    to be what's called typed。 meaning you don't have to have the same data type。
    That's how a lot of lists work in a lot of different programming languages。 You
    can intermix strings with numbers and custom data types。 The main takeaway before
    we dive in here is that this is an ordered0 based index， meaning。It will be added
    in the order you add them， and the first item is always0。From zero。 it goes to1
    and two and so on and so on。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， let's go ahead and create a list first thing you'll notice in our notes
    here is I have these square brackets right here。What that denotes is that it is
    a list， it's important that you remember that because we're going to talk about
    other data types that are very similar to a list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they are different and they use a different style。First things first， let's
    create our list。 remember the square brackets， I'm going to say x equals square
    brackets。And anything we put inside these square brackets becomes part of the
    list。For example。 I'm going to say Brian。And we're going to add another item by
    our syn comma and then whatever we want to put in here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we have two strings in there。Now， really hurt your brain。 if you're coming
    from another language。 I'm going to add a number。 That's right。This is not a typed
    list。 You might be used to something like C++ where well， you have to have a specific
    type。 it can only have strings or only have numbers。Python is not like that at
    all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It makes it very flexible， very easy。So let's go ahead and put a note in here。We
    can mix data types。And let's go ahead and print this out。And I want to say list。Go'ming
    to print our list out。It'll copy and paste。 Let's put this down here and let's
    get the length。So you can see right off the bat， our list is this right here and
    it's inside those square brackets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: always remember square brackets are lists， and we can have two strings and a
    number we could add whatever we want。 and there are three items in there。If you're
    coming from another language。 this may actually hurt your brain because you're
    going to go wait a minute。 you can't have multiple types， but with Python you
    can。It makes it super convenient。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: super easy to create your own data structures on the fly。Let's make a special
    note here about indexing and positioning。 so this really confuses a lot of people。We
    think like， well， humans， the first item is always one。 well computers don't think
    that way and the first item is always zero because you're starting with nothing。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So when we talk about lists， this is zero based。Let's go ahead and let's grab
    our friend print here。And let's say， we want the 0。So to grab the first item in
    that list。Simply say square brackets and the index。 Now， note we are not creating
    a list。 We're saying inside of that list， get that index。 In this case， it's the0
    or the first item。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to put that in all caps for you newbies out there， the first item
    is0。Remember。 humans think the first item is one， computers think the first item
    is zero because you're starting with nothing。Now， if you watched the previous
    video on strings， and I hope you did。 you understand what slicing is。 But just
    in case you skipped it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a slice is a lot like making a slice of bread。 You have a nice bake loaf of
    bread in front of you。And you don't want the whole loaf if you just want a slice
    of it or a slice of pie is probably a better example。So we're going to print this
    out and we're going to slice this。So I'm going to say， I want X。 and then we're
    going to。 You guessed it。 Now， notice those are square brackets as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We didn't cover this in the last video。 But， yes， when you see that square bracket。
    that means we want a piece of this list。 or in this case， a slice of it。I'm just
    going to put some quotes here。P are some quote some comments， slice the list。So
    what this is going to do is it's going to say X and we have a starting position
    and an ending position。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to go from the first to the second。 Now， remember the first is not
    the first item。 It's position one。 Remember that gets super confusing as far as
    zero based indexes。To illustrate that。One to two position is actually Karen's。So
    what we're doing is we're taking this list here。And we're saying0，1。To two， so
    it's going to stop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If we omit this second position， we're going to get the remainder of this。 We're
    going to say we want that whole slice right there。 So let's demonstrate that works
    as expected。Slicing is a very convenient way of getting a sub item。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_8.png)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You may be thinking lists are great， but now that I've created the list， how
    do I add items to it。 that's a common question。So that's what we're going to cover
    in this little section here is how to add the items and you can either append
    or insert。And both of them do well exactly what they sound like they do， for example，
    X。pen。We are going to say a pen pizza。And let's go ahead and X dot append。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm doing this twice for a reason， and you'll see why here in just a second。And
    add beer because everybody likes pizza and beer， right now we want to insert。So
    aend will put things at the end in the order you put them。 noticeice we did two
    appends。 pizza and beer， so it's going to add pizza， then it's going to add beer
    and it's going to do both of those at the end。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now insert。Allows you to say， I want to put this at a specific position。So because
    we're talking about a specific， I need to give it a number。 and in this case one。
    you notice it wants an index， an integer of where you're going to put this in
    the list。So I'm simply going to say one。And let's add cats。So following along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what we're doing here is we're adding pizza to the end of this list， then we're
    adding beer。Then we're going to go to the one position， not the beginning。 the
    beginning would be 0。 remember。 we're going to go to the one position。And add
    cats。Let's go ahead and add a few notes here。That way。 anybody who downloads this
    code off GitHub will just have the notes and be able to easily follow along。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， let's go ahead and do a print。And I want to see this list in its entirety。And
    let's see what this looks like。Okay， down here。 you can see we have our list and
    we have Brian and then cats got inserted in the first position。And then my name
    Karen's 46， and then it did pizzas and beer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very important to understand that append will do it in the order you append
    it。 So it put pizza at the into the list。Then it put beer at the end of the list。Very
    simple once you wrap your head around that just trips up a lot of newbies。Just
    bear that in mind when you're adding things if you want a specific。Index。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you need to do insert if you want to slab it at the end， you do a pen。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_11.png)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Okay， now that we've added items， let's talk about how we get rid of items。
    We're talking about removing。 Let's remove pop and delete。 And these do things
    very differently。 even though。At first glance， they may seem very， very similar，
    so I'm going to say X。That remove。No want to remove cats。I'm not a big fan of
    removing cats becauseuse I happen to love cats。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But you know what I mean， we sometimes you just got to get the cats out。So what
    remove is going to do is go through and remove the first item here。Sra our print
    statement。 slap that down here， and let's run this。All right， so you can see Brian
    Kas， Karens。 now it's Brian Karen's， we remove cats， so just remove that first
    item there。Now， let's talk about。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Up now。Don't get excited， pop is not like Coke or pepsi or anything like that
    but。What we want to do is we want to remove an item， but at the same time return
    it。 meaning we want to be able to work with it here。So I'm going to say I equals。
    and we're going to do X dot index because we want to find something here。 We want
    to find pizza。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now this will raise an error if it's not found in there， so if you just look
    for something crazy。 it's not going to return negative one and there really isn't
    a fine remember we talked about fine in the last video where it returned a negative
    one。 this is just going to say， hey， there's an error and it's going to crash
    your program。That sounds really bad until we get into more advanced discussions
    where we talk about how to get around that and why it even exists in the first
    place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So。Just big leap of faith at the moment。We know that pizza is in there because
    we appended it。We're going to get that index because nobody wants to sit here
    and count and figure out what position this is actually at。We're going to say
    food。And we're going to pop。Now， when you think pop。Think of it like popping the
    top off of an nice cold soda or beer， whatever your favorite beverages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you now have that cap in your hand after you've popped it off。That's at least
    how I learn P。 so when you pop off the cap you still have that cap in this case。
    it is the item at index of whatever pizzas is at。Sounds super confusing， it really，
    really does。 but it's really simple once you see it in action。 So what we're going
    to do here is I'm going to clear this list just to avoid any confusion。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to run this。Boom， so what's going on here。 We have our list
    and see there's pizza in there。And we're going to pop。 meaning we're going to
    pop the cap off that thing that's in our hand and we now have that bottle cap。And
    that bottle cap is pizza， so we can now use that， but once we've popped it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's no longer in the list， see how it removed it。Very convenient if you want
    to remove the item。 but at the same time， use the item。Seems a little confusing，
    but bear with me。That is actually used quite a bit when you get in a little bit
    more advanced programming。All right。 next up， we're going to talk about deleting。So
    I want to say I equals。Say X index。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's get the index of beer。Because again， no one wants to sit here and
    go zero，1，2， three。 no one wants to do that， we just want the computer to figure
    out where it's actually at for us。So once we get that index， and I should put
    a special note here。This will raise an error。 if not found。But once we get that，
    we want to actually just delete it。 So we're going to say D EL。X。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then whatever that position was。Now this will delete the item without returning
    it。 and I'm going to copy and paste some notes in here。So delete a specific item
    without returning it。Where pop will remove。And return the item。Fundamental difference
    there。Which one would you use and why， Well， pop is if you want to actually use
    it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: delete is if you want it gone。 Now， when you delete this。It's gone， you cannot
    use it。 it doesn't even exist in memory anymore。And that's why it's called delete。
    because you're literally deleting that out of memory。 If you're coming from like
    C or C plus plus or any other language that does memory management， Yes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you are actually deleting that out of memory。 Now， under the hood。 what's really
    happening is Python's flagging that for garbage collection and all this other
    fancy stuff that newbies don't really understand。 But if you're more of an advanced
    person， that's what's going on is Python saying。😊。Get rid of it out of the Python
    internal list。Were just going to let garbage collection wipe it out later on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Save run， this is what's going on here， so we found the index of beer in we
    deleted it。Pretty cool。 pretty easy to understand so major takeaway from removing
    items if remove will remove the first one。 pop will remove it， but let you play
    with it and you can do whatever you want and delete will well actually delete
    it and get rid of it。Let's talk about extending or adding elements from another
    list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this will be a little bit confusing， but bear with me here。There's a reason
    why you would extend rather than just add a list and it's because Python you can
    actually add lists into list。 which we're going to cover at the very end of this
    video， but it gets super confusing。So let's look at this。 so we're going to say
    we're going to make another list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's call this cats。Tma， dogs。那么。Bds and in case somebody out there is
    like， well。 how would you actually add a comma， you wouldn't add a comma directly。
    you'd added as string like that。But we're just going to add in cats， dogs and
    birds。Into our list called Y。 Now the list we've been working with is called X。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we want to take the contents of Y and put it inside of X。 So we're going
    to say x dot extend。Sometimes intelligencetelence helps us out， sometimes it doesn't。And
    we're going to extend with the Y list。Let's go ahead and print this out。Notice
    we're printing X。 what do you think pop quiz， what do you think this is going
    to look like when we run this？Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you said it's going to have the contents of both lists， you're absolutely
    correct。 Now。 notice how what it's done is it's taken R X。And added the elements
    of Y to it。 so these are now。True items inside of X。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_14.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Very cool how that works。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_16.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's talk about sorting and when I say sorting， we mean sorting and reverse
    sorting。 meaning doing the exact opposite of like an alphabetical。 So let's go
    ahead and say。Sort in reverse。 Now， think of this as like sort ascending， sort
    descendending now。Our list is a mixture right now。 And what do I mean by a mixture，
    So if we just take this。Prennt this out， run it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see how we got string， string， int， string， string， string。We're going
    to have problems with this integer and we're going to have to take that out。 and
    I'll demonstrate this really， really quickly。 so I'm going say x dot sort。And
    this is where a lot of newbies get tripped up and it goes not supported between
    instances of end and string。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it's exactly that so it's saying it knows how to sort strings。And it knows
    how to sort numbers。 but it doesn't know how to sort a string to a number。So think
    about that。Let's say you have a table in front of you。And I come in and I dump
    a bunch of potatoes and a bunch of apples and I say sort these。Well， how do you
    want them sorted， Do you want the potatoes in the apple sorted or do you want
    them sorted by color。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but they're all different colors。 And this is what I mean， Python gets really
    confused。 And it just says， you know what， I'm not even going to try and figure
    this out。 I'm just going to drop an arrow and let you just figure it out on your
    own。The easiest way to get rid of this at this point is to simply remove it。 Some
    must say X dot remove。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We're going to just remove that hint。And then we're going to sort。So now it's
    alphabetical because we've removed that。 It knows exactly how to sort these strings。
    Bir。 Bryan， Karen's， cats， dogs。 Very， very simple。 The polar opposite， of course，
    is reverse。 And we're just going to grab this for the sake of time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Pretty self explanatory what's going on there。This would be like sort ascending，
    sort descendending。I almost wish they didn't call it reverse， but called it like
    sort descend or something like that。 or you know had a parameter inside of sort
    and we'll talk about parameters later on。 but it can be a little bit confusing，
    but just think of sort as you're going to sort alphabetical and reverse is the
    polar opposite of that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You notice how。When we sorted， we had to remove that int。 simply because sort
    will throw some sort of error if there's a mixed type。 Now。 what if you wanted
    to do that。But you didn't want to really modify the original list。Well what we're
    going to do now is called a copy and some people call this cloning with this various
    shallow clone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but basically we're just making a copy here， So we're going to say y equals
    x dot copy。Does exactly what you think it does。 It actually makes a new list and
    copies the elements into it。 so we're going to say。Proopies the elements into
    a new list。Now we can simply say why dot reverse。And we could add items， remove
    items， do whatever we wanted to do so I could say， well， I got aend。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's go ahead and pan apples。We could do any other thing we really wanted to
    do here。 so let's grab this print statement here。So x is the original。New is R
    Y。Let's see what these look like here。So our original remains unchanged where
    our new now has apples and it's been reversed。Pretty cool the way that works and
    then if you were done with wine and you didn't want anymore。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you just simply delete it。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_18.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Which is what we're going to talk about next。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_20.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Okay， so deleting。嗯。Delete the whole thing is really what I'm going to put here。Why
    would you want to delete something？ Well， in the previous little segment here。
    we said we're going to make Y and Y is a copy of X Now that we're done with Y。
    we don't need it anymore more。 We can do one of two things。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can either let Python garbage collect it， meaning it's going to figure out
    when it's not needed any more。 or we can specifically say delete the whole list。And
    yes， that deletes the whole thing。So if I try to say something like print， why。It's
    going to have a bad time here and it's going to say name why is not defined。 And
    you remember from a previous video， whenever you see is not defined。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it means it simply does not exist， meaningan we have now destroyed why and everything
    in it has been destroyed as well。 So all that memory for your computer nerds out
    there iss now freed up and gone。 We can use it for other things。This really becomes
    important when you start talking about embedded systems and things of that nature
    where memory might be a little bit more constrained than。 say your desktop or
    your laptop。You got to understand that when you delete something， it is gone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I mean， gone gone is not defined means you would have to rebuild this entire
    data structure from scratch。 There's simply no way to recover it。Deleting can
    be a little bit drastic， as we saw。 name Y is not defined is well kind of a problem。
    I mean。 what if you didn't want to delete the entire variable you just want to
    delete part of it or clear the whole thing off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what we're going to talk about in this little segment here。We're talking
    about clearing。 Think of your list like a big table， and you got plates and dishes
    and all sorts of stuff on there。 You don't want to throw the whole table out。
    You just want to clear it off。 And that's exactly what clear does。So it's going
    to clear。All of those elements out of the list。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the list itself will still exist。 It will just be blank。 demonstrate that。The'
    type cleared。So most of the time in programming land， you don't actually want
    to delete。 You just want to clear it out。 So our list exists， you can see by these
    brackets。 there's just no elements in there。And we can actually test that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's go ahead and get the length of X。So it exists， but there's no items in
    there。Most of the time。 if you're confused， just think of it this way。 Delete
    is throwing the entire thing out。 You're throwing the whole kitchen table out
    where clear is you're just clearing the dishes off the table。Usually you want
    clear， not delete， but delete exists in case you need to free up that memory。

- en: You want to do something a little crazy。 A list can contain other lists。 And
    if you look at this。 it looks kind of weird。But just think you have a start bracket
    and an in bracket。 followed by start end， start end and start and end。 So that's
    right a list。Can contain other lists。 If you're coming from another language，
    think of this like an array of arrays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's kind of advanced and it's not something a newbie really understands。 But
    in case you're curious。 this is how you would do it。 So we're going to say x equals。
    and we're going to turn x into a blank list with nothing in it。W equals。 and we're
    going to create another list， and we're going to say 1，2，3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's go ahead and make another list， called Z。And in here， I'm going to
    say。My name。 you go ahead and put your name。Or cats， dogs， birds， whatever you
    want to put in there。So now we have three different lists。 What we want to do
    is we want to。Take the contents of。Z and y and put them in X。 Some say x stop
    aend。Let's go ahead and pen why。Now。

- en: what I've done is I've taken。All of these numbers and put them inside of X。Let's
    go ahead and print this out。Now， I'm saying merge， but that's not really what
    we're doing here。 We're actually merging all these into one giant data structure。
    You notice how we've got these double brackets here。So what we're saying is this
    item。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this individual element is its own unique list。So I'm going to say list。Enless。All
    right。 now what we want to do is we want to take。The contents of Z。And put them
    in X。 but we want to put them before all the other stuff that we put in there。Say
    X insert。And let's go ahead and put this at the zero index， and we're going to
    put all of Z in there。

- en: Let's go ahead and run this。And you see now our list。Actually， is made up of
    two smaller lists。Newbies may look at this and go， well， there's five items in
    here。 there's really not。 Let's go ahead and test this out here。 So we're going
    to say。Grab this and let's call this our lists。And let's go， Lyn。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we're going to get the number of items in here。There's only two items in
    there。Very simple。 very easy to understand。Now let's say we want to grab the first
    item。We want to say zero and we want to go。0。And let's go ahead and grab that
    second item。So our first item is this list here， which is its own little list
    and。Second item is this list here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And in case you're wondering， yes， you can get kind of nuts here。What we're
    doing now is we're diving into those lists。So in our first list。Right here。 we're
    going to grab the first item。Which is prime In our second list。 we're going to
    grab the second item notice that's at the one position， which is2。

- en: Seems super confusing， but just think of it this way。 Think of it like a stair
    step every time you see these brackets。You're going deeper down a step into the
    basement。So for example， we could switch this around here。And we can grab the
    very first item， which was one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could switch this around again and say we want the second item。Which is three。Seems
    super confusing if you're in a newbie， but trust me， once you get into more advanced
    stuff。 this is a huge， huge time saver is just simply putting lists and lists
    and when you start working with things like web services。 you're going to find
    that quite a bit where the data they're going to hand you is basically a list
    of lists and you just simply have to navigate through it。

- en: Okay， a little bit of bonus material here。 I know I'm going to get the question。
    So I thought I would just add it。 How do you change an item。 Remember， it's positional。So
    for example， let's say x equals， and let's just make some numbers here，1，2，3，4，5。We
    want to actually change this When I say change this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we don't want to change the whole list just one specific item。 So what I'm going
    to do is I'm going to say X。 and then whatever the item number is。 So let's say
    I want to change。The item at position 2。And we want to change this to。The word
    test。Remember， this is zero based and this trips up a lot of newbie， so we have
    zero，1， two。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so this guy right here， we're going to change that。It's go ahead and print this
    out。And let's sit in action， there we go。01，2， our two position is now test 4，
    five。 so that is very simple how you change something。lot of people， especially
    me。 take this for granted because it is so simple and easy to work with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and if you worked with other languages， you may be looking for like a change
    element ad or swap element or something like that。 It's actually very simple。
    You take the list， you take the position and then you assign it a value。![](img/b0272746902c5defc47db2b7d950ab97_25.png)
