- en: 哦。In all the examples you have seen so far， we use a single column to uniquely
    identify the rows in a given table。 For example， in the customer's table。We have
    this customer ID column which uniquely identifies the rows in this table。 but
    there are times that we cannot use a single column to uniquely identify records
    in a given table。 for example， look at the order items table。In a table， we have
    columns like order ID， product ID。
  id: totrans-2
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and so on。Now if you look at the data you can see that the values in the order
    ID column are repeated。 they're duplicated， we have 2，2，2，66 and so on， so we
    cannot use this column on its own to uniquely identify each record the same is
    true for the product ID the values in this column are also duplicated so in this
    table we use the combination of the values in both these columns to uniquely identify
    each order item as an example in this order we have three items for products one。
  id: totrans-3
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 4 and6 and for each product we have the quantity and unit price。😊。So if we use
    the combination of the values in both these columns we can uniquely identify each
    order item。 in other words we don't have two records for order ID2 and product
    ID1 we only have a single record for that item right now let's open this table
    in the design mode so over here click on this middle icon that looks like a tool。😊，Note
    that this yellow key that represents the primary key exists on both these columns。
  id: totrans-4
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is what we call a composite primary key， a composite primary key contains
    more than one column。😊，Now why does this matter Well when you have a table with
    a composite primary key you need to learn how to join that table with other tables
    for example。
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here we have this table order item notes that we use to keep notes for each
    order item let's take a look at the data here so we have this column note ID which
    uniquely identifies the records in this table next to that we have order ID and
    product ID you learn that the combination of these two columns uniquely represents
    an order item。
  id: totrans-6
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So here for order number two， for product number one， we have two notes。😊。Now
    let me show you how to join this table with the Order items table。😊，So back to
    our query。😊。You can see that I have already selected the SQL store database。 so
    I'm not going to type out a use statement。😊，All right， let's select everything
    from。
  id: totrans-7
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The Order items table。Give it an alias。😊，Now we need to join this with order
    item node。 also we give it an alias。😊，How are we going to join these tables based
    on two columns back to the order items table？
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: These are the columns that we need to use in our joint condition。So in the order
    items table。We have this order ID column。This would be equal to the same column
    in order item Note table。 so OIN dot order ID。But this is not enough， we should
    also join these tables based on the product ID column。 so we type out and and
    then we type out our second condition。
  id: totrans-9
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这些是我们在联合条件中需要使用的列。因此在订单项表中，我们有这个订单 ID 列。这将等于订单项备注表中的同一列，所以是 OIN.dot.order ID。但是这还不够，我们还应该根据产品
    ID 列来连接这些表。因此我们输入“and”，然后输入我们的第二个条件。
- en: so order items do product ID should be equal to order item notes do product
    ID。This is what we call a compound join condition， so we have multiple conditions
    to join these two tables。![](img/53c7c09d8eb1f22d1330df77256a9f36_2.png)
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以订单项的产品 ID 应该等于订单项备注的产品 ID。这就是我们所说的复合连接条件，因此我们有多个条件来连接这两个表。![](img/53c7c09d8eb1f22d1330df77256a9f36_2.png)
- en: Oh。![](img/53c7c09d8eb1f22d1330df77256a9f36_4.png)
