- en: In this video， we're going to focus on how to copy Excel formats in Excel using
    the format painter and also other methods。 So let's take a look at this spreadsheet
    here。 a spreadsheet of student test results。 Let's say I decide to spruce this
    up a little bit。 make it look a little better by applying some format。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Maybe I want the background color of the cell to be a dark blue。 maybe I want
    the text to be white I think that looks pretty good。 So what if I now want to
    copy that format to other cells in my Excel spreadsheet。 Well。 one way to do that
    would be to click on the cell that I want to emulate and then hold control and
    tap C to copy the cell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then I could move over where I want to paste the same Excel format let's
    say here in J1 and then I would go here to the home tab clipboard ribbon and there's
    an option here for paste。 If I go to the bottom part of that paste button。 there's
    an arrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: An option to paste special and now I can choose formats。 I only want to paste
    the formats。 I don't want to paste the values or the formulas or anything else
    just the formats I click OK and it still says top scores it doesn't say student
    name but the same exact format from D1 has been applied to J1 Now instead of using
    the tab and ribbon I could have simply held the control key held the alt key and
    tap V Control alt V gives you that same pastspec dialog box that pops up and so
    I could have selected formats that way and gotten the same results。

- en: Another option we have for copying Excel formats is to use the format painter
    Here it is it looks like a paintbrush you can find it on the home tab Home ribbon
    in the clipboard group and the way this works is kind of confusing at first for
    people but basically you click on the cell or range that has the formatting that
    you want then you click the format painter and it seems like nothing happened。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But look at my mouse pointer。 It now has a plus sign next to a paintbrush that
    tells me that I'm in format painter mode and I can click on anything in Excel
    to apply that same format。 I'm going undo that now let me do the same thing but
    this time by double clicking on the format painter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I can do the same thing but not just once but multiple times。 Anything that
    I click now will have the same exact format as is in D1。 So that's a nice quick
    way to apply a format to multiple cells in Excel。 I could even click and drag
    a whole range to apply that same formatting to the entire range。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll undo that。 Now that format painter also works well with copying the formatting
    of an entire range。 So for example， with this range here， let's say I want to
    make it so that all the borders are visible and bolded I want first and second
    and third place to be bolded as well and maybe I want to add a different color。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here in column I。 So that's my formatting for this range of data here。 But what
    if I want to apply all of that formatting to this range below。 it seems like that
    would take multiple steps， even if I'm using the format painter。 I would have
    to format paint each cell the way I want it to be right？ No。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: actually no if I click and drag and select the entire range。 I can then go to
    the format painter click and then click and drag the range I want to apply that
    same format to and I release the mouse button and that formatting is copied exactly
    to the second range。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could double click between columns J and K so that you can see that a little
    better。 same thing between I and J。 So this format painter is a very powerful
    way to copy Excel formats。 whether you're just simply copying one cell or an entire
    range of formatting。 It works great。 Let's look at another way to copy Excel formats。
    Let's say I want to set up my own banded rows in this range。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now there are faster， easier ways to do this but just as an example。 let's say
    I would like this row。To be light blue， this row to be white。 this row to be light
    blue again。 Well， I've set up cell D3 to be light blue。 If I want to copy the
    formatting of this cell across to the right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what I can do is I could right click on the autofill handle many of you know
    that the autofill handle this little green square in the lower right corner of
    this cell that I've selected that enables you to click and drag to either copy
    or extend the contents of a cell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case， it's copying Betty scrubs across to each of those cells that I
    dragged the autofill handle over I'm going undo that So that's if you left click
    What if you right click on the autofill handle。 you can click and drag across
    release and it gives you options to choose how you want to handle that autofill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would like to fill formatting only so it did not change the data itself。 but
    instead it copied the formatting across like I said before there are easier ways
    to do that。 but now that you know that you can write。Click on the autofi handle
    to extend formatting I know that you'll see opportunities when that would be a
    great way to copy Excel formats So those are a few different ways to copy Excel
    formats from one cell or column or range to another cell column or range Thanks
    for watching I hope you found this tutorial to be helpful。
