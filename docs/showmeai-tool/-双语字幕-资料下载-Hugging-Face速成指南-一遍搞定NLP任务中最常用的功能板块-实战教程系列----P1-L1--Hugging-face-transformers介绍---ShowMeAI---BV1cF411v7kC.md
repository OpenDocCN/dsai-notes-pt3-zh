# 【双语字幕+资料下载】Hugging Face速成指南！一遍搞定NLP任务中最常用的功能板块＜实战教程系列＞ - P1：L1- Hugging face transformers介绍 - ShowMeAI - BV1cF411v7kC

Hi， everyone。 I'm Patrick。 And in today's video， we are going to learn how to get started with Hagingface and the Transformers library。 The Haging F Transformers library is probably the most popular NLP library and Python right now and it can be combined directly with pytorch or Tensofflow。

 It provides state of the art natural language processing models and has a very clean API that makes it extremely simple to build powerful NLP pipelines。 So today we have a first look at the library and build a sentiment classification algorithm。 I show you some basic functions。 And then we have a look at the model hub。 And then I also show you how you can fine tune in your own model。 So let's get started。 Allright。

 so to get started， you should。😊。
