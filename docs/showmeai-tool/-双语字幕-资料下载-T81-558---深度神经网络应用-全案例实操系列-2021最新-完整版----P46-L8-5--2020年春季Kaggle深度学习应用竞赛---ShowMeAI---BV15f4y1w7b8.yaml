    Washington University。 Well， is that time of the semester Again， It is time for
    the 2020 spring kle competition for my class。 Now， this semester， it's going to
    be on computer vision。 This is the first time we've done computer vision。 So I'm

  zh: 嗨，我是Jeff Heaton。欢迎来到华盛顿大学深度神经网络的应用课程。好吧，又到了学期的这个时候了，是我班级2020年春季Kle比赛的时间。现在，这个学期将围绕计算机视觉。这是我们第一次做计算机视觉，所以我对此感到兴奋。
- en: we did natural language processing。 Last time， I think this is a great deep
    learning applicable technology in this one。 we're gonna look at faces， and we're
    going to see if we can detect if they're wearing glasses or not。 Now， these are
    faces that I generated with Gs。 So we're going to use the latent vectors of the
    Gs to try to detect eyewear。 as well as the images themselves to see all my videos
    about kggle neural networks and other AI topics。

  zh: 当我研究GANs并进行这项工作时，我对自己提出的挑战是尝试编写一个算法，生成一堆要么戴眼镜要么不戴眼镜的向量。我只是纯数学。没有，甚至不查看图像。我的算法相当准确。
- en: I went through about 30 of these before I found one that was that was not correct。
    So I had asked my algorithm to generate this person with glasses， but it did not。
    So even if you build a perfect classifier。 So you sit there with your teammates
    and label all of these which you're not supposed to do。 but sit there and put
    in。😊，A a1 or a zero completely on your own with no neural network whatsoever。

  zh: 我翻了大约30个这些，才找到一个不正确的。所以我让我的算法生成这个戴眼镜的人，但它没有做到。所以即使你建立了一个完美的分类器。你和你的队友坐在那里标注所有这些，而你本不应该这样做。但你可以自己完全用没有任何神经网络的方式输入。😊，1或0。
- en: you still wouldn't get a perfect score because you would using your human brain
    would have said this person does not have glasses My algorithm。 assume assume
    that you would So if you want to get the absolute highest scores。 there's almost
    two levels to this challenge First level is just figuring out from the vectors
    or from the images who has glasses who do not have glasses and then the second
    if you truly want to even conquer the noise。 then you could potentially try to
    figure out which of these individuals were misclassified maybe their vectors are
    close to each other in high dimension space。

  zh: 你仍然无法获得完美的分数，因为你用人脑可能会说这个人没有戴眼镜。我的算法假设你会。所以如果你想获得绝对最高的分数，这个挑战几乎有两个层次。第一个层次是从向量或图像中找出谁戴眼镜，谁不戴眼镜；第二个层次是如果你真的想征服噪声，那么你可能需要找出这些个体中哪些被错误分类，也许他们的向量在高维空间中彼此接近。
- en: maybe clustering would figure out I'm honestly not sure I have not tried to
    analyze it。If you watch my other video on looking into the latent vector。 and
    I'll put a link to it in in this competition description link。 you might get some
    clues into how you would do this。 So in theory。

  zh: 也许聚类会找出，我老实说不太确定，我还没有尝试去分析它。如果你观看我另一段关于潜在向量的视频。我会在本次竞赛描述链接中放一个链接。你可能会得到一些关于如何做到这一点的线索。所以理论上。
- en: you could potentially get a perfect zero log loss without hand labeling。 And
    even if you hand labeled again， you're not supposed to。 But if you did。 you would
    still not get a perfect score because you would get these wrong。 I think there
    might。 I think there are clues in the vectors。 I would think that there in some
    sort of high dimensional space close to each other。

  zh: 你可能在没有人工标注的情况下获得完美的零对数损失。即使你进行了人工标注，实际上你也不应该这样做。但如果你这样做了，你仍然无法获得完美的分数，因为你会有错误。我认为向量中可能有线索。我认为它们在某种高维空间中彼此靠近。
- en: but I'm not not entirely sure。 watch the other video， you， you'll see more about
    that。 All right。 So that is this semester's competition， you have any questions，
    leave them in the feedback。 if you have any questions， leave them in the comments
    and good luck on this semester's competition。 Hopefully， I made it neither too
    easy。😊，Or punishingly hard。 So always my goal。

  zh: 但我并不是完全确定。观看另一段视频，你会看到更多相关内容。好的。这就是本学期的竞赛，如果你有任何问题，请在反馈中留言。如果你有任何问题，请在评论中留言，祝你在本学期的竞赛中好运。希望我没有让它变得太简单。😊或者难以承受。我的目标始终是如此。
