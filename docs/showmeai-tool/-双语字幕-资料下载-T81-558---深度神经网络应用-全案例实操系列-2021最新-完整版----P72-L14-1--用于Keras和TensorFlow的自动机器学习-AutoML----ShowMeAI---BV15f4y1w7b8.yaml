    aren't you just trying to automate me out of a job are you trying to replace my

    my opinion of these in 2019。 This changes rapidly。 Automl is huge。 There's tons
    of companies startups that want to get into this everything from a couple guys
    in a garage forming a startup to fairly large second and third round startups
    that that are doing these kind of things。 Rapid miner is one of the older ones。

    miner是较老的一家，存在了很长时间。

    you the free version of it in a moment。 it is it's not my favorite。 but it's it's

    co），这是一个将自动机器学习作为其一部分的平台，你可以很好地使用它。
- en: They call it low code no code So you're not doing a lot of coding citizen data
    scientists so these are people who are not terribly technical but still want to
    do data scienceency sort of things。 Data coup is very good for them。 data coup
    really really tries to be just about everything and I think that's perhaps one
    of their downfalls is they attempt to be auto machine learning but not the best

  zh: 他们称之为低代码无代码，因此你并不需要进行很多编码，公民数据科学家（citizen data scientists）是指那些技术水平不高但仍希望进行数据科学相关工作的人。数据合并对他们来说非常好。数据合并真的努力想做到几乎所有事情，我认为这可能是他们的一个缺陷，因为他们试图成为自动机器学习，但并不是最好的自动机器学习。
- en: They attempt to be data preprocessing， but not the best data preprocessing So
    there's lots of companies that specialize in all the parts of data coup does Data
    robot in my opinion was really one of the pioneers of Automl and they were founded
    by kle masters back when you didn't have a kaggle grandmaster many of them are
    now grandmasters and they founded their company on their kgel winnings How cool
    is that So I'm very fond of these last two really data robot and H2O driverless

  zh: 他们试图进行数据预处理，但并不是最好的数据预处理。所以有很多公司专注于数据合并涉及的所有部分。在我看来，数据机器人（Data robot）是真正的自动机器学习的先驱之一，它们是由Kle
    Masters创办的，而那时候你并没有很多Kaggle大师，现在许多人都是大师，他们凭借Kaggle的奖金创办了公司，真酷！所以我对最后这两个公司，特别是数据机器人和H2O无驱动技术（driverless）非常喜欢，我认为这是两种最佳技术。

    for an individual。 They're quite expensive for a fortunetune 500， maybe not so

    I'm particularly fond of it。 It's okay but they have a free version and I'm going
    to launch it rapid miner is pretty expensive itself。 if you pay for the interesting

- en: So itll create either classification or regression and this one helps cross
    validate。😊。NeworkThis is all the same code that we saw earlier in this course
    where we're setting out classification。 So notice if you're classifying it does
    do Am to turn the dummy variables for your output into an actual index because
    that's what you need to evaluate it and we also make sure that we evaluate an
    accuracy if we're classifying RMSs if we're not and we just build the auto samples

    data sets here that you can run the automl on summer classification summer regression。
    You honestly don't have to think about it that much other than specifying it here。

    to run it as class and it's going to attempt to do auto machine learning just
    like rapid Minr was doing。 So this first part that I do it analyzes the data set

    suggesting that we Z score the ID。 it wasn't quite smart enough to figure out
    that there was too many unique values。 I'm going to change ID to ignore we don't
    want to do anything with the I The job it decided to make it a categorical and
    that's fine it shows you the distribution of the various categories here area
    is also going to be a categorical income common aspect it is choosing to z score
    those and that is fine Subs is also dummy categorical Z score z score those are
    fine Those are fine age interestingly it is choosing to dummy it's just because
    there weren't that many ages it thought it was a category let's z score that I
    think that's a better decision population density is definitely a z score and
    then the final output product it is going to consider those as category so I'm
    going to go ahead and save it so that we now have a modified version of the control
