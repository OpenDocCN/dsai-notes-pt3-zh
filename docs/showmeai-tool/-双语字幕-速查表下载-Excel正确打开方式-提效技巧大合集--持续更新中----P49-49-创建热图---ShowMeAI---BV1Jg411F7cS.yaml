- en: In this video I will show you how to easily and quickly create a beautiful heat
    map out of your data in Excel„ÄÇ So here we have a spreadsheet with a list of different
    foods and some detailed information about those foods„ÄÇ and I collected this information
    by using the data tab and the data types group if you want to know how to do that
    watch my video on the topic but with all of this data in the spreadsheet it's
    hard to really understand and digest what the data mean„ÄÇ So to help with that
    I'd like to use a heat map„ÄÇ Here are a few examples of other heat maps„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

- en: heat maps are often used as a way to show the temperature in a geographic location
    let's take a look at this example„ÄÇ So this shows temperatures across the United
    States but heat maps are also used for other things„ÄÇ maybe to show where population
    centers are or where there's higher crime or lower crime in a place and they can
    also be used completely separate from geography to indicate in this case what's
    critical what's minor etc„ÄÇ But one of the best things„ÄÇ

- en: A heat map is that it can give the viewer an immediate sense of what the data
    means and what stands out in that data„ÄÇ So let's look at how easy it is to set
    up a heat map kind of effect in my spreadsheet So the first thing we need to do
    is select the data that we'd like to turn into the heat map and unfortunately
    you can't just click and drag and get all of it at once let me show you why if
    I get all of that data that I'd like to turn into a heat map and then I go to
    the home tab in the styles group I can go to conditional formatting and go to
    color scales and you can see as I put my mouse over the different options I get
    basically a heat map effect if I choose this option here the lowest numbers will
    be in red and the highest numbers will be in green if I switch to this option
    it will reverse that the highest number will be in red the lowest number in green
    and there's all of these different options and you can look through those and
    choose the one that best fits the heat map that you want to create I'm going stick
    with this at least for now„ÄÇ

- en: But like I said a few seconds agoÔºå this is not the right way to do it for such
    complex data as what I have in this spreadsheet„ÄÇ Let's look at why When I selected
    all of my data and then applied the conditional formatting the lowest numbers
    no matter where they are in my spreadsheet were colored as red and the highest
    numbers were colored green that's not exactly what I want I don't care how this
    number relates to let's say calories or fat or protein I want to know how the
    amount of vitamin A in carrots relates to the vitamin A in asparagus„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say or in he So I'm going to undo by holding control and tapping Z I'll
    undo the heat map or the color scale that I applied to this data„ÄÇ I just wanted
    you to see why it's important at least in this situation to select only the data
    that you want to be compared so I want to compare the calories of each of these
    foods to each other with that selected I go back to the home ribbon„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the Sts group„ÄÇAdditional formattingÔºå color scales and that same green to yellow
    to red color scale„ÄÇ Now it works beautifully„ÄÇ I can just glance at this„ÄÇ and I
    can see right away that the chicken breast has the most calories out of this list
    of foods Now„ÄÇ as you can see some of the serving sizes are a little off„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I can see also right away that asparagus is very low in calories„ÄÇ Now I'm
    going go ahead and do this for each of these columns of data„ÄÇ I'll just click
    and drag to select everything that I want to be compared with each other„ÄÇ go to
    conditional formatting color scales and I'll select that same option„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Give me a minute to do so and then I'll resume the video„ÄÇ Okay great„ÄÇ I've finished
    applying the color scale to each of the columns„ÄÇ Now that this is done„ÄÇ I might
    want to actually think it through a little bit better„ÄÇ Maybe I'm trying to highlight
    what is particularly good or healthy about each of these kinds of foods„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: SoÔºå for exampleÔºå in the case of calories„ÄÇ it might actually be better to have
    high calories show up as red showing that maybe that something that you need to
    be„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ![](img/5762d0720cf51cda53a9d888ea062c01_7.png)

- en: Care so I would just highlight the data againÔºå conditional formattingÔºå color
    scales„ÄÇ and I can switch it to the opposite option„ÄÇ So now some of the perhaps
    healthier options show up in dark green„ÄÇ and some of the higher calorie items
    show up in dark red I can do the same thing with the fat column maybe someone's
    trying to reduce the amount of fat that they eat or carbohydrates or whatever
    it might be„ÄÇ I'll just select fat and I'm holding the control key on the keyboard„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'm also selecting cholesterol„ÄÇ let's say we want to limit the amount of
    cholesterol„ÄÇ and then vitamin A vitamin C calcium we'd like to keep those high„ÄÇ
    so the higher numbers could be better„ÄÇ and so they're in green„ÄÇ so I'm going to
    leave those as is„ÄÇ but I would just like to change fat and cholesterol to match
    calories so that the higher numbers will be marked with red and the lower numbers
    with green So with both of those columns selected„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going go to conditional formatting color scales and we' swap the option
    again so that in these cases the lower numbers show up as green So there isn't„ÄÇReally
    one correct way to do this„ÄÇ It just depends on the data and the information that
    you're trying to share„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way I have this set up nowÔºå it's meant to show what foods are perhaps healthier
    with maybe fewer calories a little bit less fat and cholesterol and maybe higher
    amounts of vitamin A„ÄÇ vitamin C and calcium„ÄÇ So I hope you can see some of the
    power of creating heat maps in Excel using conditional formatting and specifically
    the color scales„ÄÇ
