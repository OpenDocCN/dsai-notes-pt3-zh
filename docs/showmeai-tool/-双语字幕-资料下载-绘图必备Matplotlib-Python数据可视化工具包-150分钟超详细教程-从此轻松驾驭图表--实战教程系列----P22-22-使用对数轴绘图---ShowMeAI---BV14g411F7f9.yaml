- en: Allright， here's one that comes in handy for some data science problems， and
    this is。 how do you plot using amic axis？

- en: So， essentially。Sometimes you might have values that grow very large， very quickly。
    that grow exponentially。 You might have a histogram where everything is clustered
    over on one side。 So these are a couple of the different use cases where。You might
    be interested in using a logarithmic access。

- en: Our X exponential is just going to be an x range from 1 to 10 with a step size
    of 0。1。 And then our y values。 So we're going do the exponential function。 So
    E to the。X times 30。 So E to the x times 30。Now， if you plot this， you'll see
    a graph that looks like this。 Now。 this is not particularly helpful， right， We
    are down here。

- en: It looks like very close to 0。 And then suddenly it just shoots up。 And but
    you'll see that our scale of our access here， our axis， our y axis is actually。
    what is this like 10 to the 129。 So this is， this is a monstrously large number。😊。It's
    just the fact that our y values are growing。 they grow so large towards the right
    side of the graph here that none of this is really on the plot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is not particularly helpful。So how might we change the Y axis？To be
    a logarithmic axis。 So this is a kind of a classic example of when you might want
    to use a logarithmic access is whenever you have some of your values that are
    in wildly different ranges than other of your values。

- en: So in this case。We come down here to our where our axis is our axes a or apologies
    A X dot。 in this case， we're going to use this set Y scale。![](img/ea03c7029a4134c6033975faebbb4891_9.png)

- en: And there is a beautiful， straight line。That shows the linear relationship。Between
    x and log of y。So this is a nice thing to do for graphs like， let me copy this
    up here just so you can have a reference。![](img/ea03c7029a4134c6033975faebbb4891_13.png)

- en: It's a nice thing to do for graphs like this， as I said before。 it also is nice
    for histograms where you have a lot of values kind of clustered on one side。![](img/ea03c7029a4134c6033975faebbb4891_16.png)
