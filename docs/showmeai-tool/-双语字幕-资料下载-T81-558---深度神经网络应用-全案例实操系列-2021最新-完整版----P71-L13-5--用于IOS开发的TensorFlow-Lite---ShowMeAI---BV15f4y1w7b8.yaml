    Washington University in this video I am going to talk about how to create a neural
    network on the edge so on an iOS device in this case。This means that the scoring
    or the usage of that neural network will actually be on a mobile device to see
    all my videos about Cale。

    going to talk about using Tensorflow light and an iOS device。 I'm sure I'll get

  zh: 你不一定希望云端做所有事情。在这个视频中，我将谈论如何在 iOS 设备上使用 Tensorflow Lite。我相信我会收到关于 Android 和其他内容的请求，但我并不专门从事移动应用开发。
- en: so I'm probably going to stick just to iOS unless I get a lot of requests for
    something else。 but for the purposes of this course。We're going to keep it just
    a one mobile device。 I'm going to use a cross platform。Version of Tensorflow，
    Tensorflow light。 which is available on a number of these。 So that increases the
    odds of you being able to transfer this knowledge to other platforms if i is not
    your thing。
  id: totrans-7

  zh: 所以我可能会只坚持使用 iOS，除非我收到很多其他平台的请求。但为了这门课程的目的，我们将只使用一个移动设备。我将使用跨平台版本的 Tensorflow，即
    Tensorflow Lite，它在许多这些设备上可用。因此，如果 iOS 不是你的首选，这会增加你将这些知识转移到其他平台的机会。
- en: And the reality is， if you're creating any sort of a very popular app。 you're
    probably going to port it to both i and to Android。And I don't remember if Microsoft
    currently has a third platform for that or if they've finally given up on that
    or where they're at。 But those are the two main ones， Android and iOS， and I happen
    to own iOS hardware。

  zh: 现实情况是，如果你正在创建一种非常受欢迎的应用程序，你可能会将其移植到 iOS 和 Android。我不记得微软目前是否有第三个平台，或者他们是否终于放弃了这个，或者他们现在的状态如何。但这两个是主要的平台，Android
    和 iOS，而我恰好拥有 iOS 硬件。
- en: So that's the one I'm going to do。And this is the app that we're going to create。
    You can see it recognizing a few things here。 We'll get more into this later。
    Okay。 so let's build a iOS app now like I said you can do this in other ways you
    can do this for Android and then also I'm using Tensorflowlow light since the
    course is mainly focused on Tensorflow Also Tensorflowlow light is crossplat you
    can use this for Android So if you do want to do this in Android it's not a complete
    loss you just need to learn the specifics to that but the code will be largely
    the same the neural network code will be but the actual app developer stuff like
    accessing the camera and other things would be completely different So they have
    a example application you're seeing it here。

  zh: 所以我将做这个。我们将创建的应用程序可以识别一些东西。我们稍后会深入了解。好的，现在让我们构建一个 iOS 应用程序。正如我所说，你可以用其他方式做这件事，你也可以为
    Android 做这个。此外，我使用的是 Tensorflow Lite，因为这门课程主要集中在 Tensorflow 上。同时，Tensorflow Lite
    是跨平台的，你可以在 Android 上使用。因此，如果你想在 Android 上做这件事也并非完全无望，你只需要学习其具体细节，但代码大体上是相同的，神经网络代码是一样的，但实际的应用开发内容，比如访问相机等，将会完全不同。所以他们有一个示例应用程序，你现在看到的就是它。

- en: You very rarely do actual training on a cell phone there's really not much out
    there that would help you to actually do this you'd have to kind of custom code
    it yourself but really you don't train on a cell phone you use the cell phone
    just for classifications youd consume all the power if you are actually training
    on it because you wouldn't have terribly optimized code Now I'm showing you here
    basically this is some of the other code that they have that is。

    actually querying it。 So I will be the first to tell you， this is Swift， and I

    that has that version of ios or higher which should not should not be difficult
    unless you're dealing with something really old you need Xcode 10。0 above Auto
    Mac， you have to use a Mac to develop i and I already have that install so I'm

- en: This is tied to your actual Apple ID that you would use to access iTune store
    and other things like that it does not cost any money if you do pay money that

    reason I don't really need that ability I have I don't sell things on the Apple
    store at least at this point in the future who knows you do need the Xcode command
    line utilities I think I already have those installed but I'll run that command

    kind of like Pip for coa applications so that's going to install Tensorflow light

    Sw the Tensorflow light package so let's copy that and we'll run it don't want
    to do the bash command along that they have there so just run it without bash
    you do have to enter your password for this and it takes some installation I'll
    fast forward through this that's installed Now this note here is very important
