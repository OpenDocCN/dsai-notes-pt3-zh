- en: In this video， I'm going to show you the easiest way to produce charts and graphs
    in Microsoft Excel。 All I have to do is go to the home tab home ribbon And over
    here on the right side there's an analysis group Now this is in Microsoft 365
    versions of Excel。

- en: if you have an older version of Excel or it's not 365 you may or may not see
    this analyze data button or it might show up as ideas but with current versions
    of Excel it should say analyze data all I have to do is click that and it gives
    me some automatically produced charts and graphs that I can pull into my spreadsheet
    very easily So Excel thinks maybe I want total purchases by first name here's
    another total purchases by first name here's total purchases showing an outlier。

- en: here's product or service as a pie chart and there are even more options if
    I click down below I get even more graphs and charts that Excel thinks might be
    relevant to my spreadsheet and my data。So I'm gonna pick this pie chart and I'll
    just click insert pivot chart and I could go up to the top and choose total purchases
    by first name。

- en: That one's not particularly useful because some people might have the same first
    name in many cases but what I've done now is added a chart that was automatically
    produced by Excel and it's now in my data。 Now what if when I click analyze data。
    What if Excel doesn't give me what I'm looking for。

- en: noticeice what we can do here。 it says ask a question about your data。 so I
    could say something like which last name purchased the most So I do a search and
    look what it did Excel thinks that this is what I want last name by total purchases
    insert pivot table and there's the answer Another one I could try how about last
    name by begin date and I could even add the word chart at the beginning。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I insert that pivot table you can see it puts the data together the last
    name and the start date for each of those people So if you。Have access to this
    button， the analyze data button。 I would encourage you to try it out and see what
    charts and graphs it recommends for you and also pivot tables and pivot charts
    that you can use to help you think about and analyze your data。 Now you'll notice
    when you click insert。 it sometimes does put that information。

- en: instead of directly on the spreadsheet like it did with this chart。 Sometimes
    it puts it on its own separate tab。 So here's a suggestion number one suggestion2
    suggestion3。 If you decide you want that on a different sheet。 you can just right
    click on it。 you can cut it。 go to the sheet where you want it to be。 click and
    paste it and I could do the same thing with these other items as well。
  prefs: []

- en: but it would be a little different I'd have to click and drag to select all
    the data Control X to copy。 find where I want to put the data， control V to paste
    in many cases， though。 you'll want to just leave them on the suggestion tabs。
    and then you could， of course。 right click to rename a tab In this case， I'll
    call this best customer。Thanks for watching。
