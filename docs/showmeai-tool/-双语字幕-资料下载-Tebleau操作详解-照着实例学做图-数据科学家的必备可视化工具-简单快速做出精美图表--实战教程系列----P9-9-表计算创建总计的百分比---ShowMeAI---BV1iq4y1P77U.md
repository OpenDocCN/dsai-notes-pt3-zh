Hello folks and welcome to another episode of Tableau in two minutes today we are going to dip our toes into the world of table calculations and we're going to use a table calculation to determine the percent of some total and the way we're going to do that is using a data about Hollywood movies so we are going to open up our text files here and open up Hollywood's most profitable stories where we'll have a link to that data set in the comments and it's one of the tableableau。

Standard ones。 And you can see that we have some films， a number of genres who the elite。Studio was and the year in which the film was made。 as well as how much money it made this worldwide gross number。 And what we're going do is we're gonna to see which genres are most profitable for which studios。

 So which studio made the greatest proportion of their profit from each genre。 And to do that。😊。![](img/1be113185084ecd023337f6376c1ffd7_4.png)

We're going to drag lead studio out here onto the row shelf。 and then we're going to drag genre out here onto the row shelf so you can see that we've now got the genres that each studio made。 Then we're going drag the worldwide gross and we're going to drop it on these ABcs right here。 One of the other things we're going to do is we're going to turn on subtotals。

 There's a good reason for that which you'll see in a second。 So we're going to go here to analysis then totals add all subtotals。 And then we're going to go back to analysis and then totals and show column grant totals。😊。So now you see we have a total for each studio， we also have a grand total down at the bottom。😊。

So what we're going to do now is we're going to look at what percentage of each of revenue was made for each genre for each studio and to do that we're going to use a table calculation。 So's one of the quick table calculation so we'll just click on the dropdown arrow on the worldwide gross pill go down to Quick table calculation and select percent of total there it is。

😊，AndNow you can see that everything in this column has been converted to percentages。 but it's interesting。 Our totals are no longer 100% because our grand total is 100%。 This is essentially saying that Lionsgate action films were not 。93% of that grand total。 We don't want it by grand total。 We want to compare across studios。 And to do that。

 we're going change the level of detail that we're using to compute this table calculation。 So we're going go again onto the worldwide gross pill down here to compute using。 We're going to select。😊，Lead studio。 Oh， I'm sorry。 we're gonna select genre。And then you'll see that for each genre。We're now computing the total within each studio for each genre。

 so each studio has a total of 100% the reason I like to have the totals on there is because it makes it much easier to see the level at which you are calculating all of these table calculations Now if we wanted to see which studio made the greatest proportion of their。

😊，Gross revenue。From a particular genre the easiest way to do that is actually to flip these two pills around and now you can see that we have for comedy。 we have null it's a useful studio isn't it so null 100% CBS made 100% of their gross revenue from comedy Fox made 100% of their gross revenue from comedy。

 20th century Fox however， made 74。7% of their revenue from drama。 so not a particularly clean data set this but you can see that by using a table calculation to calculate the percent of total we've been able to do a number of things that make these numbers comparable across different studios。

😊，If we wanted to have the percentage of comedy revenue generated by each studio。 we could do that and we do that by going to this compute using again and then clicking on Le Studio。 you'll now see that the comedy numbers。And now a little bit smaller because we got a lot of。A lot of studios making comedies and we can go back to analysis and add back in our subtotals because obviously they came off。

When we change there and you can see that now it's adding up to 100% for each genre。 so essentially by playing with that level of detail。😊。And to asking whether we were calculating at the genre or at the lead studio level。 we're either calculating the percent of revenue in each genre that was made by each studio or the percent of revenue each genre made for each studio。

So two sides of the same coin thank you very much for joining us for this episode of Tableau in two minutes if you have any questions please leave them in the comments and obviously this will be on the website you can download the data from our website just look for the link in the comments thank you very much and we will see you next time。
