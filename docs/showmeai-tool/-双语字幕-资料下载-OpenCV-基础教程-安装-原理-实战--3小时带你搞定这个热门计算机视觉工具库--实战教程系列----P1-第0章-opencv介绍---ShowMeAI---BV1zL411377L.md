🎼So if you are a beginner， don't worry， this course is for you。 who will skip all the voluntary staff and focus on the practical implementation。![](img/3fe5bb4609f7a8a8ccd4c78a238230e7_8.png)

So you can get the computer vision skill set you have always wanted in your CV。🎼By the end of the course， you will become familiar with the core principles of OpenC and apply different techniques to solve real world problems using computer vision。![](img/3fe5bb4609f7a8a8ccd4c78a238230e7_10.png)

🎼Before we begin， let's look at the structure of the course。🎼We will start with introduction to images， then perform the required installations。🎼Then we will learn to read images， videos and webcas。🎼Along with some basic must no open safety function。🎼Later， we will learn to resize and crop images。

🎼Then we will draw different shapes and text on images。🎼From there we will get into some more advanced topics such as word perspective joining images。Color detection， contourward detection， and even face detection。After we have understood the fundamentals， we will create three different projects using these core principles。

🎼These projects will include virtual paint。Bapor Scner。And the number plate detector。![](img/3fe5bb4609f7a8a8ccd4c78a238230e7_16.png)
