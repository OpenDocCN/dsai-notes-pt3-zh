- en: In this tutorial， I'm going to show you how to create a calendar in Excel。 and
    there are several ways you can do this， but let's look at the easiest method。
    but I'll also throw in some exciting features and options that I think you'll
    like。 So let's say you're just in Excel like I am here。 The first thing I would
    do to create a calendar is go to the file tab here in the upper left and click
    and then go down to the new button when you click on that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it gives you the option for a blank workbook and some other options。 but I'm
    going to browse down the page ways。 and you can see that there are some templates
    that you can use。 There are some budgets， some invoices， and there also are some
    calendars。 So I'm going to go here to academic calendar and I'll click on that，
    And by the way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you don't see this particular calendar。 or if you want to find other calendars。
    you can just go up here to the top， search for online templates and type in calendar
    and it will give you many。 many more options。 besides those。That I have installed
    by default on my computer。 But anyway。 I'm just gonna to go down and choose the
    academic calendar。 Just double click on it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It brings up a preview， and then I can click create and here is my academic
    calendar。 As you can see， the template puts in some default dates for parent teacher
    conferences and things like that。 you may want to delete that if it doesn't match
    reality。 which it probably won't up at the top of this calendar， you can see that
    by default。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it has the current year。 But if I want to， I can change this to， let's say 2021。
    Now。 watch what happens to the dates on the calendar。 When I tap enter。 they adjust
    And so this is a great builtin feature to these Excel calendar templates that
    whatever year you put into this cell。 it matches the date numbers and the days。
    And so that's why I think far and away。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the best way to create a calendar in Excel。 It just saves you a tremendous
    amount of work。 Now， what if you don't start in August， you can just click here
    on August。And maybe you want your calendar to start in the month of January。 That's
    okay。 You can just go up。 choose January， and everything adjusts。 But again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this is an academic calendar and in the United States that generally means August
    would be the first month。 I love that fact that you can just change it。 And this
    Excel template just adjusts the dates and the days。 So I'm going browse down to，
    let's say August 17。 let's say this is the first day of school。 Notice that the
    way that this template is built。 In addition to the number underneath it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's a big cell in which you can type whatever the event is。 So I'm going
    to type in first day of school。 And then if I browse down， you'll notice。 even
    though I selected August， the rest of the months are here。 It just starts with
    August。 So I can browse down to let's say the month of May， May 28， last day of
    school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going browse back up to the top。 And let's go into September。 Let's say。Every
    Friday in September， there's gonna be a pop quiz。 Okay。 so I can click and type
    that and then I could just click away and then go back and hold control and tap
    C to copy that。 and then I'll just paste that same event onto every Friday in
    September。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's say that every Tuesday homework is due same kind of thing I could
    just do control C control V to paste。 All right， so you get the idea， you just
    click type the events for each of these days。 if there is an event。 I'll just
    put assembly here on the 21 August。 But you just fill in those events。 You can
    even put the times in there if you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And this calendar is coming together nicely。 If you want to dress it up a little
    bit。 you can。 you could click and drag to highlight a particular month。 And then
    here on the page layout tab if you want， you could change the colors。 you could
    pull in some themes。 So those are some options that you have。 But I'm going to
    undo those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Changes and just get back to the default that came with the template。 I think
    it looks good the way it is。 Now， at this point， I've got a nice calendar。 I could
    save this。 I could share it with people digitally if I want to。 But in some cases。
    you're going want to print In order to print， you just click file print Ally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can also hold control and tap P。 and it takes you to the print interface。
    and it gives you a nice preview of what the calendar will look like when printed。
    And I think this is going to look great。 There's September with all the homework
    and pop quizzes。 Poor unfortunate students。 There's August with the assembly in
    the first day of school。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is print ready。 Now， I wanted to show you another option that you have。
    One thing you could do to make your events stand out a little bit。 is you could
    use some conditional formatting。 And it's actually pretty easy to do this。 All
    you would have to do is select the entire spreadsheet。 If you hold control in
    tap A。😊。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It selects the entire spreadsheet。 So control a and then go here to the home
    tab home ribbon in the Sts group。 Look for conditional formatting。 If you click
    there。 there's an option for highlight cells rules。 text that contains。 So I want
    to look for text that contains the word quiz。 If it does contain the word quiz，
    then I want to highlight it with yellow fill with dark yellow text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I click O， let's see if it worked。 let's go to September。 there you can see
    that the cell background now is in yellow and the text is dark yellow。 So that
    helps to draw attention to the days with quizzes。 At least if you're printing
    in color or if you're sharing the calendar digitally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What about homework， I could do the same exact thing。 control a to select everything。
    conditional formatting， highlight cells rules， text that contains homeworkwork。
    By default。 it wants to format it。With light red fill with dark red text。 But
    I'm going to change that。 I'm going to go to custom format。 and I can just go
    here to the fill and choose a different color。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can even change the pattern style if I want to。 and then click O。 that doesn't
    look very good in my opinion。 So I'm going to undo that。 But the idea is that
    you can actually create your own custom color schemes and custom format here on
    font。 I can change the automatic color of the actual text itself。 So let's say
    dark green border。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Do I want it to have a border or not， I'll say yes， let's have an outline And
    then fill。 let's fill it with orange。 click O， click O， again， I'm not thrilled
    with my choice。 So I'm going to go up here to conditional formatting。 And this
    time。 instead of going to highlight cells rules。 I'm going go down to the very
    bottom where it says manage rules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there I can change the options that I picked。😊，So this particular one here。
    I'm gonna double click on it， and I'll click format。 And even though that didn't
    look totally familiar。 it is basically the same information that I put in before。
    So I click okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: click okay click apply and okay， and that's a little bit better。 Okay， so I've
    got homework do。 I've got pop quizzes there。 Now， let's say in the month of November，
    let's say on this day here。 what is that Wednesday， there's a pop quiz。 I tap
    enter and immediately it's formatted based on the rule that I set up。 What if
    there's homework due on this particular day。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can type in homework and it formats it appropriately。 So conditional formatting
    in this case can be great for color coding your Excel calendars。 Thanks for watching。
    I hope you found this tutorial to be helpful。 If you did。 please click the like
    button。
