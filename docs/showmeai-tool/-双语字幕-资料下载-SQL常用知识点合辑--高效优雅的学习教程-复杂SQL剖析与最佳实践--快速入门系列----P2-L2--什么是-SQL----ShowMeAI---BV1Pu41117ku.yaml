    and how we use them。A database is a collection of data stored in a format that
    can easily be accessed in order to manage our databases。 we use a software application
    called database management System or DBMS We connect to a DBMS and give it instructions
    for querying or modifying data the DBMS will execute our instructions and send
    results back。

- en: 🎼Now we have several database management systems out there and these are classified
    into two categories relational and nonrelational also called no SQL In relational
    databases。 we store data in tables that are linked to each other using relationships
    That's why we call these databases relational databases Each table stores data
    about a specific type of object like customer product order and so on SQl or SQL
    is the language that we use to work with this relational database management systems
    It looks like this We use SQl to query or modify our data In this course we're
    going to learn everything about this powerful language Now there are many different
    relational database management systems out there Some of the most popular ones
    are MyQL SQL server by Microsoft and Oracle but of course there are plenty more
    Each database management system has a different flavor of SQL but all these implementations
    are very similar and。

    learn in this course will work with any database management system in this course
    we'll be using Myql which is the most popular open source database in the world。![](img/45f5389e40bd87f7429076c836fc11f1_6.png)

- en: Right now back to this diagram What about nonrelational databases in non-relational
    databases we don't have tables or relationships These databases are very different
    from relational databases but that's a topic for an entirely different course
    What you need to know is that nonrelational database management systems don't
    understand SQL they have their own query language so we use SQl to work with relational
    database management systems Now before we jump in and install mysQl let me clarify
    something quickly as you talk to different people you will hear two different
    pronunciations of SQL SQL or SQL What is the correct way Well it depends on who
    you ask and of course everybody thinks their way of pronouncing this word is the
    right way but here's a little history about this language SQL was originally developed
    at IBM in the 70s and back then it was initially calledQL short for structured
    English query language but they changed the acronym to SQL becauseQL。

- en: was the trademark of an airplane company So to this date there has been an argument
    about what is the right way to pronounce this language Journalally speaking。 people
    in non-english speakingak countries call it SQL I'm used to calling it SQL because
    it's shorter and sweeter than SQL but if you prefer to call it SQL that's totally
    fine with me I'm not going to get mad at you so that's the history behind this
    language but what about my SQL as a software product developers of this product
    prefer to call it my SQL rather than myQL but they don't mind if we call it myQL
    In this course I'll be teaching you SQL with My SQL。
