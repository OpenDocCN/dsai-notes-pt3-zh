- en: 哦。In this tutorial， we're going to look at the between operator in SQA。So let's
    say we want to get the customers who have more than 1000 and less than 3000 points。When
    me rate the query is like this where points greater than thousand well more accurately
    greater than or equal to 100 and points less than or equal to 3000。 When we execute
    this query， we get。😊，How many we get four people that satisfy this criteria？

- en: Now whenever you're comparing an attribute with a range of values。 you can use
    the between operator and this makes your code shorter and cleaner so we can rewrite
    this expression like this where points between thousand00 and 3000 This is exactly
    equivalent to what we had before。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so these range values are also inclusive That means points is going to be greater
    than or equal to 1000 or less than or equal to 3000 let's execute the query。 we
    get the exact same result。😊。![](img/0fd125c9f59bc110486d7eb215bf21b1_2.png)

- en: All right now， as an exercise， I wanted to write a query to get the customers
    that are born between January 1st。 1990 and January 1st，2000。![](img/0fd125c9f59bc110486d7eb215bf21b1_6.png)

- en: All right， so we start with select star。From customers， where？Burth on the line
    date between。 so what matters here is that we can use the between operator for
    date values as well。 it's not limited to using numbers。So we're birth date between
    now we need to supply two date values。 so as I told you before， the format for
    dates is four digits for the year， so 1990。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: two digits for the month and two digits for the day。So the birthday should be
    between this value and here's a second value， 20，0，1 and 01。Let's execute this
    query。We get。![](img/0fd125c9f59bc110486d7eb215bf21b1_9.png)

- en: Only three people will match this criteria。Oh。![](img/0fd125c9f59bc110486d7eb215bf21b1_11.png)
