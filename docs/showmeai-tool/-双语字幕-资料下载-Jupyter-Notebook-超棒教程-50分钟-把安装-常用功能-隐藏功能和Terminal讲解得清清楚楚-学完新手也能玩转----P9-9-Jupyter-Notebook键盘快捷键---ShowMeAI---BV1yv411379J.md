Minu items， which is the keyboard shortcuts。So I think that you can be much faster。

 much more efficient with Jupyter Notes if you learn just a couple of these， just a couple of these。

So some of my favorites。Let me see if I can find them。 Here we go。 A insert cell above。

B insert cell below X， cut selected cells。Running shift enter is going to run a cell。

You'll see the enter here is entering the edit mode is what I was talking about。

As far as actually entering code into a cell versus being in the kind of blue execution mode where you can use these keyboard shortcuts。

 if you find yourself doing something over and over again， learn the keyboard shortcut for it。
