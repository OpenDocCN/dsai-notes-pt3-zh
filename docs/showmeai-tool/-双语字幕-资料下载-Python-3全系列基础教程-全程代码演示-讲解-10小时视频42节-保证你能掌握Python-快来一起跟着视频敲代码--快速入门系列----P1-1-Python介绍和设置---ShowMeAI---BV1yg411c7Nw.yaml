- en: Everyoney everyoneÔºå my name is BrianÔºå and we're gonna to learn Python 3„ÄÇ This
    video series is aimed at the complete beginner„ÄÇ So if you have zero programming
    experience„ÄÇ this is what you need to watch„ÄÇ NowÔºå we're going to start off in this
    specific video with how to install configure and test Python 3„ÄÇ and I'm going
    to try to make a video a week„ÄÇ So definitely check back often as I'm going update
    this series as fast as I can„ÄÇ

    already installed„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ you can and probably should use your operating systems
    documentation to figure out if it's installed„ÄÇ but a veryÔºå very quick way is simply
    bring open a command line„ÄÇYou don't know how to open a command lineÔºå I highly
    suggest you go out to Google and learn how to open a command line„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's not super hard and once you get to this pointÔºå type in something like this„ÄÇAan„ÄÇ3„ÄÇIf
    you see this right here where it says„ÄÇPythonÔºå and then some version„ÄÇ it's already
    installed and ready to go„ÄÇ and you can simply skip the next step„ÄÇHowever„ÄÇ if you
    don't see thisÔºå if you get like command not found or unknown command„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you're going to have to follow the next step and actually install Python„ÄÇ
    Special note„ÄÇ a lot of documentation out there„ÄÇWe'll say type the word Python„ÄÇ
    This is the older version of Python„ÄÇ This is Python 2„ÄÇ![](img/9f6c197f4ec196be1569c0ee7dc94ea1_2.png)

- en: OkayÔºå assuming you ran a command line and tried Python 3 and got a big fact
    command not found or command unknown„ÄÇ you need to install itÔºå go out to Python„ÄÇorg
    and then go to downloads„ÄÇ![](img/9f6c197f4ec196be1569c0ee7dc94ea1_6.png)

- en: From here you can either click all release or you can go into your specific
    operating system„ÄÇ we're going to go to all releasesÔºå it will try to auto detectect
    what you're doing„ÄÇ however you may need to pick your operating system„ÄÇThe vast
    majority of you are probably going to be on WindowsÔºå so I'm just going to click
    on Windows„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Then click on Python 3 release the latest oneÔºå notice this is a Python 3Ôºå not
    a Python 2„ÄÇAnd scroll all the way down„ÄÇThey've kind of got these jumbled up together„ÄÇ
    you notice it how you've gotÔºå you guessed itÔºå a tar ballÔºå something for Mac„ÄÇ and
    then stuff for Windows Windows has the vast majority of the options and this is
    why it gets a little bit confusing„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: HonestlyÔºå I'd go with this one„ÄÇ Windows X 86 64 executable installer„ÄÇ That's
    going to be an offline installer it's going to have everything you need to run„ÄÇ
    or at least it should„ÄÇ You're going to download that executable and run it„ÄÇ You
    may be prompted to run as administrator and you may have to restart your computer
    when you're done After you're done installing„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you will definitely need to go back and double check„ÄÇ You should be able to
    open a command line and type Python  3„ÄÇIf you cannot get to this step„ÄÇ you may
    have to go to Google and look for your specific error message to figure out what's
    going on„ÄÇ![](img/9f6c197f4ec196be1569c0ee7dc94ea1_8.png)

- en: Now that Python's installed and configured and we can bring up a command line
    and type Python 3„ÄÇ we need to test this thing outÔºå make sure it's actually working
    the way we expect it to„ÄÇFirst things firstÔºå I'm just going to drag this up like
    this to take up the rest of the screen„ÄÇ And we're in what's called the interactive
    shell or interactive mode„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We are not going to be using this very much becauseÔºå wellÔºå it's a bit cumbersome„ÄÇ
    If you make a spelling mistakeÔºå it's impossible to go back and fix it„ÄÇSo we're
    going to use an IDE„ÄÇ but right now we're just testingÔºå I want you to do something
    like this say„ÄÇX equals5 times3„ÄÇNow we're going to type the word print„ÄÇAnd thenÔºå
    let's say X„ÄÇNotice that's in brackets„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we're going to cover all this later right now we're just simply testing„ÄÇYou
    should see 15 on the screen„ÄÇTo be brutally honest„ÄÇPyping Python 3 and even seeing
    the version is really the true test that this is working„ÄÇ However„ÄÇ I wanted to
    show you there is an interactive mode if you want it„ÄÇAgainÔºå though„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's really hard to go back and edit configure and you're going to make mistakes„ÄÇ
    so we're not going to use this at all„ÄÇ we're going to use an IDE or an integrated
    development environment„ÄÇ which we're going to cover in the next step„ÄÇ![](img/9f6c197f4ec196be1569c0ee7dc94ea1_11.png)

    thousands of IDs„ÄÇTo be brutally honestÔºå you don't need anything fancyÔºå you can
    use a simple text editor„ÄÇReally„ÄÇ what an IdeE is is a very fancy text editor with
    a lot of functionality built on top of it„ÄÇYou'll probably find a lot of documentation
    that says iddle comes directly with Python that's not really true anymore„ÄÇ

    I don't think it's the greatest Pycharm is another good one„ÄÇ but we're going to
    be using something called visual studio code„ÄÇ and I know a lot of folks really
    are not Microsoft fans„ÄÇ

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to go into Python 3„ÄÇClose this out„ÄÇ Now I need to add in some extensions„ÄÇ
    and this is what I love about Vi Studio code„ÄÇ is you can extend this to work with
    just about any language„ÄÇ So I'm going to say Python„ÄÇAnd you seeÔºå there are tonsÔºå
    and I mean„ÄÇA lot„ÄÇ I could just scroll down forever and ever„ÄÇTo like infinity and
    beyond kind of forever„ÄÇ I mean„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    right at the top„ÄÇYou can see this guy right here„ÄÇFrom MicrosoftÔºå26 million viewsÔºå5
    star ratingÔºå you just simply go„ÄÇ okayÔºå do you actually need itÔºå That's a good
    question„ÄÇ because you could go through and spend hours just installing all of
    these and not know what you really need„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we're going to take a short detour„ÄÇ Go back here„ÄÇThis is simply the folder
    we opened„ÄÇ I'm going to say new file„ÄÇ and let's call this test dot P Y„ÄÇAnd it
    automatically recommends extensions for us„ÄÇ a Python file will end in dot PY„ÄÇSo
    it's detecting that extension and sayingÔºå hey„ÄÇDo you want to use the recommended
    extensions„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I'm going to sayÔºå you know whatÔºå why notÔºüAnd it's going to automatically
    go out there and install them„ÄÇAnd that's going to sayÔºå installed„ÄÇAnd it's used
    globallyÔºå there we go„ÄÇ and we can even click this little gear icon and play around
    with it„ÄÇIf we really felt like„ÄÇLet's go back to our file or we can use it up here
    depends on how you want to get there Now this is my only real criticism of visual
    Studio code is it does tend to clutter the UI a little bit„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so occasionally you'll see me closing things out„ÄÇAnd I'm just going toÔºå well„ÄÇ
    start using this bad boy„ÄÇOkayÔºå to wrap this video up„ÄÇ we're going to make what's
    called hellello world„ÄÇ This is kind of the obligatory first application you're
    going to make in any programming language„ÄÇ It's actually a rite of passage for
    programmers„ÄÇ and it is very simple is just printing out the words hello world
    on the screen„ÄÇ

    you should have your IdeE„ÄÇ whatever you're usingÔºå even if it's just a simple text
    editor„ÄÇ and„ÄÇYou should have a blank file called test„ÄÇpyyÔºå the name's not super
    important„ÄÇAnd„ÄÇLast but not least„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should see the Python interpreter„ÄÇ I have Python 36Ôºå9„ÄÇ You can actually
    switch to different ones if you wanted to just be aware that you can use different
    versions„ÄÇI'm going to type the word print„ÄÇAnd then we're going to give it some
    brackets„ÄÇ anything in the bracketsÔºå it's going to try to print„ÄÇNow with Python„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can use double quotes or single quotes„ÄÇI have a habit of using double quotes„ÄÇ
    but it really doesn't matter which one you choose„ÄÇAnd then type the wordsÔºå hello
    and world„ÄÇClick save„ÄÇNow you should have this little guy right here that says
    run Python file in a terminal„ÄÇ if notÔºå you can go up hereÔºå you're going to have
    a few options„ÄÇ

    have no idea what those means„ÄÇ Debugging sounds reallyÔºå really bad„ÄÇ So what does
    this really meanÔºå Debugging is a special mode in programming where if you have
    bugs or errors in your code„ÄÇ it will walk you through them and help you fix them
    or more to the point point them out to you so that you can fix them„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    let's actually„ÄÇGet rid of that„ÄÇ And we want to go back to what we did„ÄÇ the interactive
