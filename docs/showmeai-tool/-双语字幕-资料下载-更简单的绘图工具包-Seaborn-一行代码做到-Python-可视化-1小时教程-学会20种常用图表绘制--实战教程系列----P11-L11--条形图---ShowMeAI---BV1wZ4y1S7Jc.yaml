- en: About categorical plotting Now with categorical plots。 we're going to focus
    on distributions using categorical data in reference to one of the pieces of numerical
    data and the first one I'm going to talk about here our bar plots So I'm going
    to say SNS and bar plot and let's say let's go and let's analyze some information
    in regards to tipping for the different males and females so we'll say x is equal
    to sex and versus the total bill so total bill and of course we have to say where
    we're going to be getting our data which is going to be from that tips data frame
    and there you can see is the differences versus the sexes in regards to the total
    bill from our tips data and this little bar right here is referencing。

- en: Varariance between the mails and the total bill amounts and so forth and by
    default。This data is going to be aggregated based off of the mean， but you can
    come in and change that。 so estimator is how you're going to change it and you
    could base it off of the median instead and you're going to be able to use all
    sorts of nupy formula。 So this is your data based off of the median you're also
    going to be able to base it off of standard deviation。

- en: AndVance。And also covariance with COV， and you could also make your own functions
    and just plug them into the estimator to change exactly how this data is going
    to be aggregated。 and that is a rough estimate of bar plots。![](img/a061d5edff4ad08bf4f5732b742b97fe_7.png)
