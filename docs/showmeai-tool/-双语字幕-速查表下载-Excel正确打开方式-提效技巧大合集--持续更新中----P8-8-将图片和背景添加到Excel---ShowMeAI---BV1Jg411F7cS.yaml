- en: In this short Excel tutorial， I want to show you how to add some images into
    your Excel spreadsheets。 And this is mostly for presentation purposes。 Let's say
    you want to show a spreadsheet to an audience。 you want to spice it up a little
    bit。 make it look a little bit more visual and attractive。 These are a couple
    of tips that you could use。 So the first option is to add a background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can do that here on the page layout tab， page layout ribbon。 And here
    in the page setup group right there， it says background。 So I can add a background。
    So I'll click background。 And at this point， I can browse my computer for an image。
    I'll just double click on one of these， select this cool nature picture， click
    insert。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now I have this beautiful background behind my data。 And you can see what
    happens as I browse down the page or as I move to the right。 You can see that
    the picture is just repeating itself over and over in the background。 So there
    are some upsides to doing this。And also some downsides。 The upside is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: obviously it added a lot of color， a lot of beauty to my spreadsheet。 The downside
    is that the background image is obscuring some of the text。 It's hard to read
    what's in this cell。 It's hard to read what's in this cell。 And these here as
    well。 So just be very careful about adding backgrounds。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the other downside is this。 notice what happens if I zoom out。 So I'm zooming
    out。 my data gets smaller。 but for the most part， the image is staying the same
    size。 If I increase the zoom zoom in quite a bit。 it does look like the image
    is changing a little bit。 but for the most part， the image stays pretty static
    in the background while the text gets much smaller or much bigger。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so the background image does not follow the data。 it doesn't stay proportional
    to the data itself。 So just be aware of that。 Now。 another option that I have
    in page layout。Now that I have a background。 I can delete the background and I
    can add a new one and notice that there is an option for a being image search。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is better in a lot of cases， better than uploading from your computer
    because a lot of times you won't have that perfect image already on your computer。
    You can also pull from Onerive if you use Onedrive。 And if you're not familiar
    with Oneeddrive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: please watch my video tutorial about it。 But here in being image search I'm
    just going to click and do a search for DVDs。 This spreadsheet that I'm using
    as an example is a DVD inventory。 And so I'm going to do a search for images of
    DVDs by default。 it's looking only for creative commons images。 So these are images
    that were uploaded to the Internet in order to be shared。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you want more than that， you can uncheck that and it will give you many more
    results。 There's also a filter button here that you can click to say I only want
    large images I only want clip。t or line drawings。 Now， the benefit of line drawings
    is because that they're black and white。 if you add them， sometimes they don't
    obscure the text quite as much。 I'm going to undo that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: though， and go back to background and again， search for DVDs。 I will stick to
    creative commons in this case。 These are images that were uploaded to be shared。
    And I'll just click on this particular image and insert。 Again， that really affects
    the readability。 And so I might need to go in and format my text so that it's
    a different color so that I can actually read it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And even that is tough to read。 I'm going to jump back to page layout and delete
    the background。 So backgrounds can be really nice， but you do really have to be
    careful that they don't obscure your text and make it unreadable。 The other thing
    to know about backgrounds。 When you add a background into your spreadsheets。 If
    you then go to print or even print preview。 noticeice that the background images。Do
    not print。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they don't show in the print preview。 So the only real purpose of background
    images in Excel is for when you're doing a presentation when you're showing your
    data to someone else。 And you want to grab their attention。 Now， let's look at
    a second option that you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of adding a background。 in many cases， it's better just to click insert。
    And here on the insert ribbon， go to illustrations and choose pictures。 Now。 this
    may look a little bit different in your version of Excel。 I'm using a very small
    screen to create this tutorial。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it couldn't fit these icons here in the space provided。 So for you。 it
    might look a little bit different。 But generally， it's found here on the insert
    tab。 insert ribbon in the illustrations group。 Look for pictures。 So I can upload
    that same image or just for variety， I'm going to pick a different image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this time， it's not a background image。 This is actually。Picture that's
    floating on top of the spreadsheet on top of the data。 And if I increase the zoom。
    the picture gets bigger， if I decrease the zoom， the picture gets smaller。 And
    so this works fundamentally differently than background images。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I can shrink that to whatever size I want it to be。 and then I can put it
    next to or on top of the data that I want it to go with。 So I know that that is
    not really a match to the title of the DVD。 but it works。 I can also try clicking
    insert illustrations online pictures。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is similar to what I showed when we were looking at backgrounds。 but
    in this case。 I have categories of images that I can pull up and use， I can browse
    through these。 and I can also do searches。 So I'm going to search for the Princess
    bridede。 and it's finding creative commons only， which in this case that's perfect。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I can select an image， click insert， and it came in way too big。But again。
    I can shrink that down。 and then I can put it with the data that it goes with。
    I might even consider in my spreadsheet inserting a new column。 That's a blank
    column。 And there in the column， I can put these images that go with the different
    DVDs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I can really make that small if I wanted to and fit it in the cell。 Now
    it's not really in the cell， it's actually hovering over the cell。 but it appears
    to be in the cell。 Now， one of the advantages of inserting pictures instead of
    using a background image。 is that once you've inserted the picture， you can click
    on it and you get a format tab and you can click on the format tab and look at
    all the formatting options that you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can put a frame around this image。 I can make it curved at the edges， turn
    it into an oval shape。 I can give it a 3D effect or a bevellled look。 There's
    all of these picture styles。 I can also change the transparency。And this could
    be particularly useful in a spreadsheet。 So at this point， even though this is
    not a background image。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's almost behaving like a background image。 And the nice thing about these
    formatting options。 I was able to use this transparency tool to make this image
    transparent so that it can sit behind the data。 and yet， I can still read the
    data。 So this may be the better way to put a background image into your spreadsheets。
    Even though it's not truly a background image。 So these are two ways to add images
    into your Excel spreadsheets。
