- en: And now I want to talk about count plots now a count plot is kind of like a
    bar plot。 but the estimator is just simply going to count the number of occurrences
    and how you call it is we say count plot and X let's say we want to find out the
    number of males and females from our data frame that we're working with and there
    you can see the total number of males versus the total number of females and like
    I said。

- en: you can come right after this function and click on shift and tab to see all
    of the additional options。 there's Hue which we've already talked about can change
    the order could change the color we're working with and pallets and saturation
    and I'm going talk about Dodge and all of these other different options as we
    continue down below and you can also read about all of the different things that
    are available and the more specifics on all of the different parameters。
