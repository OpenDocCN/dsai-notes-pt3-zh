- en: This video is fixing common Excel problems。 Part 2。 It's the second in a three
    part series on some strategies to try in order to fix common Excel error。 And
    I have a spreadsheet here to go along with this video。 I hope that you'll download
    it by looking in the description below the video。

- en: And this workbook should look pretty familiar。 if you watched part 1。 you can
    see that it has still the div0 error message。 If you want to learn how to fix
    the div 0 error message， please watch part 1 here in part 2。 we're gonna look
    at some strategies for fixing the null error。 the nu error。 and the hashtag error。

- en: Let's start first with null。 The main reason why you will see the null error
    is if you use a space in your formula when you actually should use a comma or
    some other symbol。 So let's do an example。 Let's say I would like to add up the
    total cost of the first。

- en: items in this list and the last five or six items so I want to leave out some
    of the things here in the middle like shipping envelopes。 I don't want to include
    those So to do this， I'm going to go here off to the right let's just say G4 it
    doesn't have to be there though and I'll type equals So this cell equals the sum
    of what well I'll put in a left parenthesis and then I'm going to click and drag
    I could type the cell references here but I'll just click and drag to get the
    first8 or so items in this list so I want to add that but I also want it to add
    let's say erasers on down So let's say here in the formula I put a space and then
    I go down to erasers and I click and drag and get the remaining items So back
    up here on my formula you can see what it looks like I'll tap enter or return
    on the keyboard but it gives me a null error Now the reason for that is because
    of this space。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here， I should not have put a space there。 whenever you put a space in that
    situation or similar situations。 What it does is it tries to identify an intersection
    of two ranges。 It's looking for where two ranges intersect。 Well， guess what。
    This range that I selected does not intersect with this range。 there is no intersection。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's why it produces an error message。 No， there is no intersection between
    those two ranges。 So instead of a space， what I really meant to do and should
    have done was put a comma。 Now。 if I tap enter on the keyboard， It's adding up
    this range and it's adding up that range and putting them together。 and it gives
    me 1757。 So if you do see this null error， double check your formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make sure you're using the proper symbols and don't have extra spaces。 Many
    times that will solve the error。Next， let's look at the nu error。 And for this
    one。 I'm gonna to switch to the health tracker spreadsheet in my workbook。 And
    as you can see。 this health tracker is a way to track the health of Jason Smith，
    he's trying to lose weight。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you can see here his weight and the change from the previous week and that's
    being tracked with a formula you can see the formula there。 It's pretty easy，
    pretty simple。 Who knows why， but let's just say that I've got to know the square
    root of how many pounds Jason lost from week to week。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， I could do that， I could type in equals S Q Rt notice it says returns
    the square root of a number and what's the number。 it's this right here。 So I
    click there。 and then I'll put in the left parenthesis。 and I need to now put
    in the number。 So I'll click here on the number0 in this case。 but it's actually
    clicking not on the number， but on the cell reference C7。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then I'll tap enter on the keyboard and there you've got the results。 square
    root of 0。Is0。 Now。 I'm going to use the autofill handle This little green square
    in the lower right corner of the cell。 I'll just click on that and hold the click
    and then drag down the page。 and it copied that formula down and it worked beautifully
    except for a couple of numb errors？ Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why am I getting these numb errors。 Basically， you'll see numb errors when you
    have a formula that try to produce an invalid number。 So if you tell Excel to
    do an impossible calculation。 It's not going to be able to do it。 It's impossible。
    So it may give you this numb error。 So why is this impossible？ Well。 I told Excel
    to give me the square root of negative 4。 And if you know how square root works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's just no possible way to get the square root of -4， Because it's a negative
    number。 Sam thing with negative 3， It's just not possible to get the square root
    of it？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So any time you see this numb error， double check your formula。Check your data
    and make sure that you're not asking the impossible of Excel。 A way to fix that
    would be to simply change negative numbers to0。 But in this case。 that would not
    reflect reality。 And so instead you may want to do an if error formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: hopefully you can see how I'm doing this。 So equals if error left parenthesis。
    and then the formula that I was using before。 and then I'll put in a comma and
    then quotation marks and quotation marks。 So basically that will print on the
    screen a blank space。 Nothing。 And then I can put the right parenthesis and tap
    enter on the keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now if I copy that formula down， you'll notice what it does。 if there is
    a numb error。 it wipes it out and pretends like there is not an error。 if there
    are no errors then it performs the formula just as I had created it up here with
    a square root。 Now there are other cases when you'。See the numb error。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's technically possible for the numb error to appear when a number is too
    big for Excel or too small for Excel。 This rarely happens， I bet you'll never
    have this happen。 But the biggest number that Excel can display。 is a number one
    with 308 zeros after it。 And if you try to go higher than that。 it's going produce
    a numb error。 So to demonstrate this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to type equals in this cell。 So this cell equals。 let's say 2000 raised
    to the power of and the way you show that is with this little carrot symbol for
    me。 it's shift 6 on the keyboard。 And then I'll just type in， let's say 7676。
    So I'm going to raise 20 to the power of 7676。 let's try that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I tap enter on the keyboard that gives me an error message because my formula
    produced a number so big。 It was bigger than。The number one with 308 zeros after
    it。 And so Excel just cannot display it。 Now。 that's also true of negative numbers。
    If I try to type in or calculate a number that is smaller than-1 with 308 zeros
    behind that。 that's also going produce a numb error， because the number is too
    small for Excel to display。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there are some other reasons why you might see the numb error they're pretty
    rare。 but watch out for those two examples that I've shared。 the third error message
    that we're gonna look at in this video is pretty simple。 pretty easy and very
    common。 and I'm going to use this third spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the movie inventory spreadsheet。 So here I have a list of movies and the cost
    that was paid to buy these movies in DVD format。 So I'm going to go down here
    to the bottom underneath them。 and I would like to get a grand total。 So I'll
    just go up here and use this autos button here on the home tab home ribbon in
    the editing group。 I can just click。That and it will auto sum everything in that
    column。 I tap enter on the keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but look， I get this terrible， ugly looking hashtag error。 Now。 the reason for
    this is very simple and the fix is very simple。 What this symbol means is simply
    that Excel cannot fit the contents of this cell in the space provided。 And you'll
    notice if I go up here to the column letter D。 I'm going go to the line between
    D and E。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can click and drag， and I can make that even more narrow if I want。 And if
    I do that notice that the text that was there before turns into hashtags。 So that
    shows that it's really just about space。 It's about being able to display the
    contents of the cell。 The solution for this is super easy。 all you have to do
    is click and drag to provide more space for that column。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that way the contents of all of these cells show up and can fit in the space
    provided。 there is an even easier way to do this。 All you would have。To do is
    double click on the line between D and E in this case。 so just double click and
    that automatically resizes the column to the perfect width so that everything
    can be displayed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we've looked at three common error messages， null， nu and the hashtag error。
    and I've shown you some of the best techniques for resolving those errors。 Watch
    for part 3 in this series where I'll cover the ref error and the value error。![](img/f281ca6b5e382dc30865e6776ee9bd66_4.png)
