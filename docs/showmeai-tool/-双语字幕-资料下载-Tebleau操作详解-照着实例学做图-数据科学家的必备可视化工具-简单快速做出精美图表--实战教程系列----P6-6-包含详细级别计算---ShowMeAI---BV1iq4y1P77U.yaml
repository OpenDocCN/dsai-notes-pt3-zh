- en: Hi folks welcome to another episode of Tableau in two minutes today we're covering
    a level of detail calculations we have two prior videos in the series that cover
    fixed level of detail calculations and exclude level of detail calculations today
    we're going to be going through the third and final one which is the include level
    of detail calculations If you remember and this is just a recap if you watch the
    other two videos fixed level of detail calculations we' aggregate a measure at
    always the same dimension a fixed dimension if you will。

    while you aggregate a measure。😊，And include level of detail calculations allow
    you to include a dimension when you calculate a measure。 when you aggregate a
    measure， so what we're gonna go ahead and do is create the same table that we
    created in our other two dashboards here so we'll drag product container out onto
    the I'm sorry we'll drag product category out onto the row shelf product subcategory
    out onto the row shelf and then we'll take our sales and drag it out onto our
    ABcs here and create ourselves a nice little table Now let's go ahead and create
    a。

    going to be a level of detail calculation where we include we're going to always
    include product subcategory and then we're going to say sum of sales。![](img/799f3b381203694440d90166075202ac_6.png)

- en: There we go。 Alright， and then we're going to drag include subcat out into our
    table here。 So you'll see that at the moment， these are the same because they're
    actually aggregating the same way and we have product subcategory in our view
    where this gets interesting is when we remove product subcategory from our view
    and we take away。

- en: We changed the level of aggregation。 So what we're going to go ahead and do
    is we're going to change the level of aggregation to maximum。![](img/799f3b381203694440d90166075202ac_12.png)

- en: And then we're going to take away product subcategory。 Now you'll see here that
    now our include subcategory is different than our sales and what this include
    is doing is it's calculating the sum of sales for each of the subcategories。 and
    then it's taking the max for whichever one of those subcategories it think it'
    is the biggest and that's what it's displaying on here。 So if we put product subcategory
    back， I just control Z to undo。😊。

- en: You can see that the maximum sum of sales within the furniture product categories
    is for tables and that's 1896008 so if we take away product subcategory and look
    at furniture you'll see that it's 1896008 so it's showing us the sum of sales
    for the product subcategory that is the biggest we could if we wanted to change
    this to min or to any other level of aggregation so if we change this to minimum
    that's going to show us the one with the smallest category so if we put product
    subcategory back you'll see that our smallest was office furnishing 698094 and
    we'll take it away again。

  zh: 你可以看到家具产品类别中销售额的最大总和是来自桌子的，总额为1896008。因此，如果我们去掉产品子类别，单看家具，你会发现也是1896008，这显示了我们能够获得的销售额最大子类别的总和。如果我们想要将其更改为最小值或其他聚合级别，如果我们将其改为最小值，那么它将显示出最小类别的产品子类别。如果我们再将产品子类别放回去，你会看到最小的是办公家具，销售额为698094，然后我们再将其去掉。
- en: 698094 and then finally we could if we wanted to we could say we wanted to average
    and that's going to give us the average sum of sales for each product subcategory
    within that。😊。![](img/799f3b381203694440d90166075202ac_16.png)

  zh: 698094，最后，如果我们愿意，我们可以选择平均值，这将给我们该产品子类别的平均销售总额。😊。![](img/799f3b381203694440d90166075202ac_16.png)

- en: Products category。And that's how you might use a level of detail calculation
    using include。 it's a good way to get two different levels of measure so we can
    get the sales for the biggest subcategory within a product category as well as
    the total sum of sales for that product category on a visualization if you have
    any questions please leave them in the comments there is a link to the data we
    used for this workbook as well as a link to the work book itself on Tableau public
    in the video description and we hope that if you like the tableableau tips and

  zh: 产品类别。这就是如何使用包含进行详细级别计算的方式。这是获取两个不同度量级别的好方法，因此我们可以在可视化中获取产品类别中最大子类别的销售额，以及该产品类别的总销售额。如果你有任何问题，请在评论中留言，视频描述中有我们用于此工作簿的数据链接，以及该工作簿在Tableau公共上的链接。如果你喜欢今天分享的Tableau小贴士和技巧，请订阅我们的频道“Tableau
