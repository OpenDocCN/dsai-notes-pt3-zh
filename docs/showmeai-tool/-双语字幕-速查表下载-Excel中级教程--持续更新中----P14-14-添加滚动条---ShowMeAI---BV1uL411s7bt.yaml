- en: In this Excel tutorial， I want to show you how to add a form control that gives
    you a scroll bar to help you adjust numbers in Excel。 If you're not familiar with
    form controls， you really should look into them。 And if there's a lot of interest
    in this particular video。 I will make another video that covers more form controls。

- en: So let me know if you're interested in that。 As you can see。 this is a simple
    inventory for a store that sells Cds in the wonderful genre of synth popop。 And
    this is just hypothetical， But you can see here at the left。 some of the bands
    whose music this store carries。 including the latest album by muse。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you're familiar with the band muse simulation theory is a really good synth
    pop Cd。 So this just tracks the bands， the albums， the genres and some of the
    other things like price of the C D。 and the quantity of that Cd that's on hand
    in the store。 Now， what happens if the quantity changes。

- en: Sa that a bunch of Cds are sold。 I need to change the quantity。 Maybe the store
    goes out and purchases some more Cds。 Again， this number needs to change。 And
    of course， you can just click and type in the new number on top of it。 but let's
    look at how to add a form control that can help you do that a little bit faster
    in some cases。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now to add a form control you need to make sure you have the developer tab here
    on the ribbon。 And I don't see it there。 So how do I get that onto the ribbon。
    Basically all you have to do is right click on one of the tabs。 and choose customize
    the ribbon。 And that should give you a pop up with a bunch of different options
    that you can add onto the ribbon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And there is the developer tab。 So I check that box。 click Now I should have
    a developer tab here on the ribbon。 It took a second to appear。 but there it is。
    Now that it's there， I can just click on it。 and look for the controls group。
    This is where you'll find all sorts of interesting and exciting。

- en: Controls that you can add to your spreadsheets。 I'm gonna go here to insert，
    and I'll click。 and here are the form controls。 And the one I'm looking for is
    scroll bar。 and here it is。 So I'll click there。 Once you've clicked on that little
    button。 Excelel now gives you the opportunity to basically draw your scroll bar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going put my mouse pointer wherever I want that scroll bar to be located。
    So right here。 and I'll left click and drag to draw out the scroll bar。 I'll just
    put it right there。 and it appears。 Now this scroll bar is basically floating
    on top of the data。 So don't worry if it overlaps your data， it's not going to
    ruin your data at all。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it won't even affect your data until you set it up properly。 And I want
    this scroll bar to effect this number of the quantity of this C。 So now that it's
    there。 I can just right click on the scroll bar。 and I need to go down and format
    the control。 Remember。 this is considered a form。Control。 So I want to format
    the control。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the most important option here， in my opinion， is this cell link。 I'm going
    scoot this over to the left。 I need to go down here to sell link and click and
    put in the cell that it's linked to。 If you prefer， you can just click this button
    here and then select the cell that you want it connected to。 And then I can just
    go back up here， click this button to get back into the options。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Another important option here that you need to be aware of is this。 the minimum
    value and also the maximum value。 So I'll just put the minimum value as being
    0。 The maximum value right now， it's set to be 100。 I'm going go up to maybe 200。
    Let's say that this Cd store doesn't want to carry huge inventories。 Let's just
    limit it to 200。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then here you can set the incremental change。 So every time I click on this
    arrow。 this number here will go up by one。 unless you want it to go up by2 or
    by 5 or whatever。So I'm gonna change it back to one。 Okay， the rest of this， I'm
    gonna leave as is。 And then I'll just click okay。 Now let's try it out。 So here's
    my scroll bar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see there's a gray vertical line， and I can click and hold the mouse
    click and drag that scroll bar to very quickly increase the quantity on hand all
    the way up to 200 if I want to。 but let's say it's 175。 I can just click and drag
    to get it to 175。 You can also use these buttons。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can click this right button to go up a couple of numbers。 And so you have
    two ways to adjust the numbers。 gradually one by one or using the scroll bar。
    you can change the number much more dramatically。 So now， of course。 I could insert
    another scroll bar for each of these C D titles。 Perhaps a faster way to do that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: though， would be to simply right click on the scroll bar and notice that that
    also give you the option to resize the scroll bar and also to move it。 So you
    need to right click on it to get those options back。 But in this case。I just want
    to copy it and then paste it。 So I'm just gonna do control V to paste。 So now
    I have a copy of it。 but remember I connected this scroll bar to this particular
    cell cell F3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this new copy of it is also going to affect cell F3 And so I need to right
    click go down to format control and tell this second scroll bar that it's supposed
    to affect F4。 So now let's test it and to really test these properly。 you really
    should click on another cell before you try to use them。 So now that I've clicked
    away。 I can go back and let's use the scroll bar and look it is affecting the
    correct cell now So I'm just going to copy paste these all the way down onto as
    many of these cells as I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I know for sure I'm going need a bunch more of these muse and cosmicity
    Cs。 so I'm going jump right down there to add scroll bars for them so that I can
    increase their quantities。 But again， I need to make sure I right click format。Control
    and link it to the right cell。 just like that。 Thanks for watching。 If you're
    interested in learning about more of the form controls。
