    other videos on those which are linked in the descriptions and I suggest you take
    a look at one of those there's a few steps to this。 it's really not that bad and
    I do want to explain some of the differences between the miniforge and Minneconda
    versions that you will encounter with this Also if you don't want to install the
    actual software onto your computer you can make it through the entire course with
    Google Coab If you watched some of my other videos you'll know that I use Minneconda

    miniforge 和 Minneconda 版本之间的一些区别。此外，如果你不想在计算机上安装实际软件，你可以通过 Google Coab 完成整个课程。如果你看过我其他一些视频，你会知道我使用
    Minneconda 和 Anaconda 的频率相当高，这两者都是由同一组开发的 Python 平台。

    video。 I'm going to show you how to use miniforge and miniforge is something new
    at least to me miniforge is supported on a variety of platforms as well but I've
    started using it primarily on the Apple M1 I suggest trying to get by entirely
    with miniforge and not necessarily even installing Anaconda because you will need
    both of them installed if you do want to make use of Anaconda if you're using
    Anaconda you're not going to necessarily or really at all。

    Anaconda，你需要同时安装这两者，如果你使用 Anaconda，你不会 necessarily 或者实际上根本不会。

    difficult to get working on M1。 there's currently issues open that have not been
    resolved yet hopefully that will improve soon but the stylegan to ADA that we
    make use of in this course makes use of actual Kuda code which is C99 type code
    that actually defines custom kernels for this so obviously that's not at all compatible
    with Apple metal you could certainly write this in Apple metal but Stgan2 AD just
    was not written that way so more advanced machine learning where it's custom written
    kernels the Mac M1 is great the metal is great but it's just not as big of an
    ecosystem as kuta so it's not going to see as much compatibility Now everything
    they would need for the course。

  zh: 有两件事特别需要注意，一个是Pytororch，Pytorch目前在M1上运行起来要困难得多。目前有一些尚未解决的问题，希望这些能尽快改善，但我们在本课程中使用的stylegan
    to ADA实际使用了Kuda代码，这是一种C99类型的代码，实际上定义了自定义内核，所以显然这与Apple Metal并不兼容。你当然可以用Apple Metal编写这段代码，但Stgan2
    AD就是没有那样写，因此在更高级的机器学习中，如果是自定义编写的内核，Mac M1非常出色，Metal也很棒，但其生态系统远没有Kuda大，所以兼容性也不会像那样好。现在本课程所需的一切。

    to add home brew。To your path。 And by the way， this assumes that you're using
    the Z shell。 Otherwise。 some of this can be different。 Mac used to use the ba
    shell。 but currently they're using the Z shellll unless you specifically change
