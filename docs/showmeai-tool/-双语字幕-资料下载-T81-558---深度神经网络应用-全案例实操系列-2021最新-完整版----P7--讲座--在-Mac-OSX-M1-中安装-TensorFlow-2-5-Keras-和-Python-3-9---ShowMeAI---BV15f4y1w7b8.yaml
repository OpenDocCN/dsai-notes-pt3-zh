    Washington University and this video I'm going to show you how to set up a Mac

    other videos on those which are linked in the descriptions and I suggest you take
    a look at one of those there's a few steps to this„ÄÇ it's really not that bad and
    I do want to explain some of the differences between the miniforge and Minneconda
    versions that you will encounter with this Also if you don't want to install the
    actual software onto your computer you can make it through the entire course with
    Google Coab If you watched some of my other videos you'll know that I use Minneconda
    and Andcona quite a bit these are two Python platforms in particular both made
    by the same group„ÄÇ

    video„ÄÇ I'm going to show you how to use miniforge and miniforge is something new
    at least to me miniforge is supported on a variety of platforms as well but I've
    started using it primarily on the Apple M1 I suggest trying to get by entirely
    with miniforge and not necessarily even installing Anaconda because you will need
    both of them installed if you do want to make use of Anaconda if you're using
    Anaconda you're not going to necessarily or really at all„ÄÇ

    So on this machine I am going to show you how to install miniforge and it'll just
    be miniforge without Anaconda I do actually run both of them on my Mac I might
    do another video on that if you're interested in seeing how to run them side by
    side definitely„ÄÇ

    have these„ÄÇAn emphasis on supporting various CPU architectures including Apple
    M1 Personal it annoys me a little bit that I can't run everything through Minneconda
    and I have to have two entire Python instances on my Mac„ÄÇ

- en: but that's the way they want to do it so let's go to my classes website there's
    various instructions on how to do this„ÄÇI am going to take you through the process
    that I've somewhat developed based on others this is a little different than some
    of the ones that you will see here but I think it's pretty streamlined and it
    gets you everything that you need for my course installed if you go to T81 deep
    learning and you go into install there's a variety of files here because for one
    thing they keep updating these various platforms and the instructions for how
    to install for my course that's changed a number of times since early 2020 when
    I put the first one of these out here and I don't like to put broken links on
    older YouTube videos so they link to to the respective version„ÄÇ

    2021 and if I make some changes to this file that don't break the video bad enough
    that I feel the need to recordcord it„ÄÇ then I will put a link to the the newer
    version of it here I'll probably if they're not breaking changes I'll probably
    just modify the file in place so these are the instructions„ÄÇI talk about basically
    what I just told you about in terms of dealing with the multiple versions and
    dealing with miniForge„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I suggest starting by installing miniForgeÔºå I like to use homebrew to do this
    I'm going to show you how to install Homebrew„ÄÇ it's similar to yum or Appgi if
    you're used to Linux„ÄÇ it's kind of like the command line version of the Apple
    store if you want to think of it„ÄÇ

    difficult to get working on M1„ÄÇ there's currently issues open that have not been
    resolved yet hopefully that will improve soon but the stylegan to ADA that we
    make use of in this course makes use of actual Kuda code which is C99 type code
    that actually defines custom kernels for this so obviously that's not at all compatible
    with Apple metal you could certainly write this in Apple metal but Stgan2 AD just
    was not written that way so more advanced machine learning where it's custom written
    kernels the Mac M1 is great the metal is great but it's just not as big of an
    ecosystem as kuta so it's not going to see as much compatibility Now everything
    they would need for the course„ÄÇ

    to add home brew„ÄÇTo your path„ÄÇ And by the wayÔºå this assumes that you're using
    the Z shell„ÄÇ Otherwise„ÄÇ some of this can be different„ÄÇ Mac used to use the ba
    shell„ÄÇ but currently they're using the Z shellll unless you specifically change
    that that will be the case go and run that it's modified that and we'll run that
    just reloads the shell„ÄÇ

    because I don't completely trust always that everything gets reconfigured like
    it should Now I should have the breww command from the command line and I do So
    this is a lot like yum or appgi or those kind of things Let's go back to my instructions
    So we installed homebrew we followed that instructions they also recommend installing
    this I think that was basically done by brew„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I'll go ahead and execute that execute that already installed So we're good
    there and then we're going to do brew install mini forge There's a variety of
    ways„ÄÇ![](img/4a3455f71b0c1dc63732e659663e9a9d_14.png)

    installation process up hereÔºå so if this isn't working for you„ÄÇ you may want to
    try that as wellÔºå but I'm going to go and copy thisÔºå run it from here„ÄÇSo that's
    going to make use of brew and it's going to install miniForge The only way that
    I could think of this possibly failing is if there's a new version of the Apple
    metal and a new version of miniforge and they're not quite compatible if I run
    into that I'll definitely post something about that then you would need to request
    to install a very specific version of miniForge we'll go ahead and fast forward
    through all of this distinctive base that shows you what environment you're in

    have this loaded onto my system„ÄÇSo I'll go into where I have it because I did
    a clone on my course and you can see the YaAml file there„ÄÇIf you don't want all
    of the material for my courseÔºå just download the YaAMl file„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

    execute this command you'll need that YamL file that I just mentioned„ÄÇIf you don't
    want all of my course materialÔºå just download the AL file„ÄÇ I have my course material
    already loaded and there it is„ÄÇI'm going to go ahead and execute„ÄÇThis Conda environment
    create command„ÄÇ It is going to go ahead and create a Tensorflow environment that
    has all of those packages installed as well as Tensorflow and the metal plug that's
    going to let you use the GPU capabilities of your M1 Mac We'll fast forward through
    this This tends to take a bit of time So now we will do the next step which is
    Conda activate Tensorflow that's also in my instructions and there we go„ÄÇ

    you what that is in a moment and we have to do this command here„ÄÇ which is actually

    know if„ÄÇEverything worked„ÄÇ This is where you cross your fingers„ÄÇ I'll go ahead
    and run this takes a moment„ÄÇ

    metal„ÄÇ which is a good sign„ÄÇSaying GPU available is an even better sign„ÄÇ so we
    are completely installed and ready to go and if you want to check it„ÄÇ just load
    up any code that uses TensorFlow just like you normally would any of the like
    training the resnet would be a great example in my material go ahead and run it„ÄÇ

    you go to the activity monitor and see the percent GPUÔºå well there it is„ÄÇ it takes
    it a moment to get started„ÄÇ so if you don't see something on the percent GPU at
    first„ÄÇ don't panicÔºå it may also be downloading„ÄÇSo the fact that we're in EpoC2
