- en: The facet grid Okay， so with the facet grid， you're going to be able to print
    multiple plots in a grid in which you are going to be able to define your columns
    and your rows So let's say I wanted to get a histogram for smokers and nonsmokerrs
    with total bill for lunch and dinner I'm going to use the tips data frame for
    this。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: And I put Fg in there for facet grid。And then you call SN S。Facet。Grid。And I'm
    going to use the tips data frame， of course。Column is going to be represented
    with time and row is going to be represented with smokers。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_3.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see we went and created our grid like system here。 and what I want
    to do now is I want to pass in attributes for my histogram。 so I'm going to say
    tips， FG， map， and plot a histogram。And。Based off of total bill。 and I'm going
    to say that I want to put this in buckets or bins of eight。

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: You can see it went automatically generated those histograms for us of pretty
    neat stuff you're also going to be able to come in and let's say you wanted to
    create a scatter plot and that's going to be total bill and let's try tips。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_7.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Compare both of those as well this is tip not tips al right and there you can
    see we created a scatter plot Another thing we're going to be able to do is let's
    go let's get rid of this and let's say that we would like to assign variables
    to different colors could do this so let's have this still be the tips data frame
    I'm going have column B time I'm going however change h to smoker and you can
    also go and change the height and then you can let's change the height to4 and
    then you can change something called the aspect which is going to be the width
    based off the height so I'm going make that be1 so they're going to be equal to
    each other let's make it a little bit bigger let's say 1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 3 then we can come down and we could say tips FG。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_10.png)

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Let's try map and let's just stick with a scatter plot here because that makes
    most sense for doing some crazy stuff。 So I'm going to have this be total bill
    and tip。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_13.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see there is our our two scatter plots。 Let's go and add some different
    options like let's say I wanted dinner to come before lunch for some unknown reason。
    I can do that。 So I'm going to say a column order is equal to dinner。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_15.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And lunch， and let's go and change our palette as well。 So we'll say palette
    is equal to。 and I'm going to use one called set one。 and I'm also going to change。The
    edge color for our dots in our scatter plot to be equal to white。 And there you
    can see with the changes that we made there。 Alright， so pretty neat stuff。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's go and show you some other options because this guy has a ton of options。
    Let's say that we would like to go and change sizes and line widths and assign
    different colors to markers and different use different markers。 These dots right
    here called markers。 I can change all that stuff。 What I want to do is I am going
    to create a dictionary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is going to represent the size of our markers。 And then I'm going to define
    the line width to be equal to 05 and the edge color to be equal to white。 then
    I'm gonna come in。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_17.png)

- en: facet grid is going to be equal to SN S facet grid tip stat frame。 let's have
    our column be equal to sex and our Hue changes are going to be based off of whether
    the person is a smoker or not。And。Let's define the height for each of these to
    be4 in the aspect ratio。 which we end up in the width， is going to be 1。3 again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's keep just adding all kinds of different crazy stuff。 Let's say we
    want to change our H order。 have this be yes， and then no for smoker。 Okay。 that's
    what that references。 And then we can also change our markers by saying h KWs
    is equal to dictionary。

- en: We'll define our marker symbols to be let's do like a upwards facing triangle
    with this carrot symbol like this。 and then let's do a downward facing triangle
    by putting a V inside of there like this All right I'm trying to figure out all
    the use all the different parameters and then we're going to assign this dictionary
    worth of data in regards to the markers as well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to say tips facet grid。![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_24.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/8d5951280297357bd612b9daf49c99c3_25.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Map and。Go and create our scatter plot based off of。The total bill。The tip amount
    and then pass in the other data that we made in regards to the markers and there
    you can see all the crazy stuff we just did with both of those all right。 so that's
    if you wanted to see just about every option imaginal and then the last thing
    I want to do with a facet grid is show you something kind of neat I'm going to
    go and get different data again。 so I'm going to go this is attendance data so
    SS dot load。

- en: Data set。And attention And what this is is this is data frame is going to provide
    like scores that were taken for different students based off of the level of attention
    they were able to provide during the testing phase that's these kind of weird
    sort of stuff and I'm going to go S and S I'm going to create a facet grid here
    again and what I want to do here is I want to put each person in their own plot
    with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 5 per line and plot each of their scores depending upon how much attention they
    were able to pay during the testing phase。 Okay， so it's kind of just neat weight
    of playing around with data。 So the column is going to be the subject。 I'm going
    to say that I only want five subjects per line So column wraps 5 and I'll define
    the height to be 1。5。 and then what I'm going to do is to do a regular traditional
    plot So I'm going to say Tt FG map and just do a regular plot plot。

- en: いや。🤢，We'll have solutions。And。Scores and then for we can also define custom
    markers So we'll say our custom marker in this situation is going be a very simple
    dot Oh and I type in column wraps instead of column wrap and scores。 this should
    be score and run it and there you can see all the individual subjects or students
    that were being tested。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: their scores and how their scores change depending upon how much detention they
    could pay Allright so just so many different ways to look at and play with data
    and to finish off this tutorial I want to talk about something you're going to
    use all the time which are。
