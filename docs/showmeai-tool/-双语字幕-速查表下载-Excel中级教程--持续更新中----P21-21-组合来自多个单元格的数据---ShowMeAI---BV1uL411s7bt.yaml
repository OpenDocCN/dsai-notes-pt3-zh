- en: In this tutorial， I'm going to show you how to easily combine data from more
    than one cell in Excel。 So let's look at this spreadsheet here。 This is a customer
    relationship tracker for a hypothetical company。 And these are all customers of
    this company。 You can see that their first name is here。 Last name in a separate
    column。 The total amount of purchases that they've made from the company and some
    other data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what if I would like to combine some of this data together。 Let's say to
    produce a customer profile。 and to put that information in one column here at
    the right。 So I can just click here in G2。 and I'll just type customer profile。
    Looks like it did not copy the format。 I'll just click here on the cell whose
    format I want to copy and I'll go here on the home tab home ribbon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: click the format painter and then click here。 and it makes the format the same。
    Okay。 so watch how I can do this。 How I can add the word Gina to the word pullin
    and。Let's say the total amount of purchases that they've made in dollars。 So I'll
    just click here in cell G3， and I'll type equals。 So this cell equals。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I want it to equal Gina， So I click on Gina。 and then I also want it to
    include the word pullin。 But if I click on pullin， it changes to B3。 So what if
    I click Gina plus pullen and hit return。 Look， Excel doesn't understand。 It doesn't
    seem to compute。 You know。 how do you add a name plus another name。 So the way
    you do this properly is you type equals click on Gina。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then you type an mpersand， or some people just call it the and sign。 So
    a3 mpersand pullen Now watch what happens If I tap enter or return on the keyboard。
    it says Gina pullen， It combined the contents of cell a3 with the contents of
    cell B3。 Now there's a problem here。There's no space between Gina and pullen。
    So let's fix that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All I have to do to put a space in is after the ampersand。 type in quotation
    marks a space using the space bar and then quotation marks again and then type
    in ampersand again。 So what this should do is it connects whatever is in a3 with
    a space and then it connects that with whatever is in B3 So I tap return or enter
    on the keyboard and it worked。 Now let's change it even more。 I want to add now
    the total purchases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll just add another ampersand， and I should probably put a space in there
    again or maybe a colon。 let's try a colon， and then I put the close another ampersand
    and maybe I want another space in there。 So I put in quote space close another
    ampersand and now I'm gonna click on the total amount of purchases here and tap
    enter on the keyboard or return if youre using。a Mac and look what we have。 Gina
    pullin $40。 If I really wanted to get picky with this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could go in and add a dollar sign。 So after the last ampersand quotation marks
    dollar sign quotation marks。 I'll need another ampersand tapap return or enter
    on the keyboard。 And now that looks just how I want it to look。 So this is a very
    simple customer profile。 but it lets me know the names of the customers who have
    purchased the most from us over the years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， unfortunately， I'm going have to do that again for every single one of
    these customers， right？
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， actually know all I have to do is click on Gina pullin 40 and go to the
    autofill handle。 I'm going to zoom in on this a little bit。 But you can see it
    here。 any time you've clicked on a cell in the lower right corner of that cell。
    there should be a very small square。 You can see it there。 It's green。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that is the autofill handle。 And what it does is that it copy。When you click
    and drag it。 it copies whatever is in the cell that is selected。 Now， sometimes
    it doesn't just copy， it extends。 And if you haven't watched my tutorial on the
    autofill handle， you really need to do that。 But in this case， I really do just
    want to copy whatever is in this cell。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some of you might say， no， you don't。 You don't want to copy Geninool and 40。
    Well。 if you think about it， that's not really what's in this cell。 If I double
    click on that cell。 Or if I just click on it once and look up here at the formula
    bar。 you can see that this is actually a formula。 It's not just geninaol and $40。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I want to copy that formula down this column。 So I'll click and hold that
    autofill handle and just drag down the sheet and release。 And look what it did。
    It combine the first name， the last name and combine that with the total sales
    from each customer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， just one thing to take note of。 the results here in column G。 They end
    up being treated like text。 So these aren't really numerical。They have numbers
    included。 but if I were to do an auto sumum， it doesn't really know how to handle
    that because these aren't really numbers。 They're just formulas that combine text
    with numbers and the result is treated basically like text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I really think the more you use Excel。 The more you'll see opportunities
    to use the ampersand to combine data from more than one cell。 and pull that data
    together into one cell。 Thanks for watching。 I hope you found this tutorial to
