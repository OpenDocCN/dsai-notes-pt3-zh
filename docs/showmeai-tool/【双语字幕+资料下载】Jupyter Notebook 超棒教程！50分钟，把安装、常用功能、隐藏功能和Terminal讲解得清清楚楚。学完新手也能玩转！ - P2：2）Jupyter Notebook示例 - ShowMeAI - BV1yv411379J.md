I am going to drag over here。 I have a， this is a a Github repository here。

 a gallery of interesting Jupyter notebooks。 So if you're interested in asking the question。

 what all are Jupyter notebooks used for。 Well， the answer is they're used for about anything that you might want to do with data and Python。

 So specifically this this person， or I guess this has probably been compiled by a lot of different people。

😊。

They have helpfully compiled a lot of different notebooks here。 So let's see， let's see。

 We've got some general Python programming， scientific computing。

 I'm going to scroll down to where are we Ma learning， statistics and probability。 Let's take a look。

At that， so。If I open up， let's say this face recognition on a subset of labeled faces in the wild dataset set。

You'll see here that using this nice little inB viewer URL。

 we're able to see this person's Jupyter notebook and see exactly the code that they used。

 see exactly what they did。

And see the images of the results。 See the graphs from the data that they're using。

And you can use normal text here to divide it up into section。

 So this is why this is why Jupyter notebooks have become more and more popular within the scientific community and also for data scientists。

 generally speaking， is because you're able to in a single notebook。

 do some experiments you're able to do some modeling。

 you're able to you're able to do you know whatever kind of transformations and manipulations with your data that you want and and train a model that does that does predictions。

![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_18.png)

![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_19.png)

![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_20.png)

![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_21.png)

And you're able to write up some context about it。 And you can share that notebook with others。

 So it's， it's a really great way。😊。

![](img/bebfc5b1a8153c6a7ba708b3cb0c3183_23.png)

To make your work more visible to others more transparent。 And， you know。

 you can share this notebook with anybody。 They don't have to be technically minded。 they don't。

 you don't have to create a web application or anything you don't have to create a whole website to just share some analysis that you wanted to do。

 So Jupiter notebooks are very handy for a lot of different things And I'm not sure what you want to use them for。

 but I'm sure it's very interesting and useful。 So let me show you how to use Jupiter notebooks。

 Let's go ahead and dive。
