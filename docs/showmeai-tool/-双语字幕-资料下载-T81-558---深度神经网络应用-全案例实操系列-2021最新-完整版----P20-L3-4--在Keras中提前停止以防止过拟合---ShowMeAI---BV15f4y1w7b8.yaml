    University。In this video， we're going to see our first technique for fighting
    against the constant enemy of the neural network programmer。 And that's overfitting。
    We're going to see how to use early stopping。 rather than trying to decide how
    many epochs。 you want to train your neural network 4。

- en: But what early stopping really tries to do is keep you from training the neural
    network too far。 This is a common visualization to show what ill effects overfitting
    can have as you train more and more。 X axis shows you the error。 The Y axis shows
    you the training time。 The dashed line is the validation set and the black line
    is the training set。

  zh: 但早期停止实际上试图避免你过度训练神经网络。这是一个常见的可视化，展示了随着训练越来越多，过拟合会产生的负面影响。X轴显示错误，Y轴显示训练时间。虚线是验证集，黑线是训练集。
- en: So what is happening to the error。 of your training values versus your validation
    values as you train longer and longer and longer。 General， the validation and
    training will be pretty similar。 The validation might be a little bit worse as
    you begin to train because。The training set is going to be somewhat overfit because
    the neural network has those values available。

  zh: 那么，随着你不断训练，训练值与验证值的错误发生了什么？通常，验证和训练会相似。随着训练开始，验证可能会稍微差一些，因为训练集会有些过拟合，因为神经网络有这些值可用。
- en: It's memorizing some of them。 It's fitting very well to the training set。 So
    the validation set will usually be a little bit worse。 as you're progressing。
    Then as the training set gets better and better and better at some point。 the
    validation set will start to almost converge away from this to a higher error
    value。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 它正在记住其中的一些。它对训练集的拟合非常好。因此，随着你的进展，验证集通常会稍微差一点。然后，当训练集越来越好时，验证集在某个时刻会开始几乎从这个点趋向一个更高的错误值。
- en: And you'll get worse and worse values on your validation。 you'll get better
    and better values on your training。 This is result of overfitting。 at this point
    here， overfitting really started to occur。 Now。 you may not recognize it till
    somewhere out here。 because you have to think， okay， it's。

  zh: 你的验证值会越来越差，而训练值会越来越好。这就是过拟合的结果。在这一点上，过拟合真的开始发生。现在，你可能不会在外面某个地方意识到这一点，因为你必须想，好的，情况在变差，或许会变好，或许会变好。现在可能不再变好了。
- en: it's getting worse。 Maybe it'll get better。 Maybe it'll get better。 Now it's
    probably not getting not getting better。 Now， there are cases where you'll go
    out this far。 And then itll it'll come back down here。 This is a value you will
    see in this class called patience。 How patient are you。To see these values start
    to move towards convergence again。

  zh: 现在，有些情况下你会到达这个程度，然后又会回落到这里。在这门课中你会看到一个值叫耐心。你有多耐心，来观察这些值再次趋向收敛。
- en: rather than diverge away into validation， just overfitting and， and not getting
    a better value。 This is what early stopping is。 You stop early。 You stop at this
    point。 and we'll see that it's important that we capture the weights here where
    we had。Essentially。 the best or the lowest validation error， which is probably
    right in here where we had the lowest validation error。
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 而不是在验证上发散，只是过拟合，而没有得到更好的值。这就是早期停止的意义。你提前停止，在这个点上停止。我们将看到捕捉到最佳或最低验证错误的权重是多么重要，这可能正是在这里我们有最低的验证错误。
- en: And then we save those weights so that we have them so that even when we decided
    to stop。 maybe here or here， depending how patient we were， we go back to here。So
    that's an important thing to remember， too， about patients。 patients will really
    not hurt you on the overall best score that you'll get at the end。
  id: totrans-10

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后我们保存这些权重，这样即使我们决定在这里或这里停止，取决于我们的耐心，我们也能返回到这里。因此，这也是一个重要的事情，关于耐心。耐心实际上不会影响你最终获得的整体最佳得分。
- en: you can be as patient as you want。 It's just going to take a lot longer。To train
    because you're going to have to go much further out if you set a gigantic patience
    number of epochs that you're willing to wait。 Now， to do this， we need to segment
    the original data set into several data sets。 Now。 Often we'll just have the first
    two， but sometimes we'll have a holdout set as well。
  id: totrans-11
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你可以根据自己的意愿保持耐心。这只会让训练时间变得更长，因为如果你设置一个巨大的耐心周期，你就需要走得更远。现在，要做到这一点，我们需要将原始数据集分成几个数据集。现在，通常我们只会有前两个，但有时也会有一个保留集。
- en: You may even split it up into more than just these three， depending really on
    what you're doing。 It also depends on how much how much data you have。 If you
    have a lot of data。 then you may split this into many training sets and really
    ensure that you're not overfitting that you're not ever evaluating based on anything
    that you are trained on。You can make this very pure， and you may even split out
    a separate validation set just to be used for nothing other than early stop。
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 你甚至可以将其拆分为不止这三组，具体取决于你在做什么。它还取决于你有多少数据。如果你有很多数据，那么你可以将其拆分为多个训练集，真正确保你没有过拟合，确保你不会基于你训练过的任何东西进行评估。你可以让这个过程非常纯净，甚至可以拆分出一个单独的验证集，仅用于早期停止。
- en: but every time you split these， you lose some of your training data。 So it's
    it's a trade off between how purest do you want to be in terms of your。Never crossing
    training and validation， never validating on anything that the neural network
    is trained on。 how much of your training set you want to train on because your
    neural network will typically perform better。
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 但每次你进行拆分时，你都会失去一些训练数据。因此，这是一个权衡，涉及到你希望在训练和验证之间保持多纯净，从不在神经网络训练过的任何东西上进行验证。你希望在训练集上训练多少，因为神经网络通常会表现得更好。
- en: at least up to a point， the bigger the training set that you give it。In kle
    competitions。 for example。I will usually accept some small cross contamination
    of training and validation。 meaning I might use a validation set for early stopping。Just
    because I know that I have that holdout set that Kaggle will eventually give me。
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 至少到某种程度，你提供的训练集越大。在Kaggle比赛中，例如，我通常会接受一些小的训练和验证的交叉污染。这意味着我可能会使用一个验证集进行早期停止。只是因为我知道我有那个Kaggle最终会给我的保留集。
- en: I can't do that too much or I overfit to even Kaggles's holdout set to some
    degree。So it's really just a trade off and we'll talk more about this as we get
    into hyperparameter tuning and other things where you do need to create additional
    set。 The ultimate insurance policy， though， is you set that final holdout set
    that you keep until the very end and you don't you don't use this for anything
    during the training process until you say。 okay， I am I'm very happy with my model，
    let me see what happens when I。Try the final。
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我不能做太多，否则我会在一定程度上过拟合到Kaggle的保留集。因此，这实际上是一个权衡，我们将在进入超参数调优和其他需要创建附加集的内容时进一步讨论。然而，*终极*保险策略是，你设定一个最终的保留集，直到最后才使用，并且在训练过程中不使用它，直到你说，好的，我对我的模型很满意，让我看看当我尝试最终时会发生什么。
- en: final holdout set。 And that's， that's the error rate that you usually decide
    to commit to as far as how。How well trained your model actually is。So this is
    what it really looks like。In terms of something like an early stopping。What you're
    going to do is take your data set。Break it into maybe 80% and 20% this 20% up
    here becomes the validation。
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 最终保留集。这就是你通常决定承诺的错误率，关于你的模型实际训练得多好。这实际上是什么样子。在早期停止方面，你要做的是将数据集分为80%和20%，这个20%成为验证集。
- en: the 80% becomes the training。And you're going to fit or train your model on
    this 80%。 and then you're going to validate it on this 20%。So you'll get a training
    error here。 That is how well it was fit to your training set， but then you take
    what you trained on that 80% and validate it with that remaining 20%。 and that
    gives you greater confidence that this is truly the error that your neural network
    is going to experience when it sees new data。
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 80%成为训练集。你将根据这80%来拟合或训练你的模型。然后你将在这20%上进行验证。因此，你会得到一个训练误差。这是它与训练集拟合的程度，但之后你将用那80%训练出来的模型与剩余的20%进行验证。这让你更有信心，这是你的神经网络在看到新数据时真正会经历的误差。
- en: Now we're going to look at early stopping and early stopping does require a
    sort of validation set。Now that causes your validation set to now be used for
    early stopping so now it's part of the training set。 so this is where it's good
    to have that final holdout set that you might want to ultimately evaluate on just
    be aware of that if you're truly using your validation set as your early stopping。
    then you probably need another validation set to actually commit to an error on
    or you can accept that maybe you've got some inflation in your validation set
    and you can truly use whatever score you stopped on as an estimate of what the
    final neural network might do。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在我们要讨论早停法，早停法确实需要一种验证集。这会导致你的验证集现在被用作早停法，所以它现在是训练集的一部分。因此，这时候有一个最终的保留集是很好的，你可能希望最终在这个保留集上进行评估，如果你真的将验证集用作早停法，请注意这一点。那么，你可能需要另一个验证集来真正承认一个错误，或者你可以接受你在验证集中可能有一些膨胀，并且你可以真实地使用你停止时的得分作为最终神经网络可能表现的估计。
- en: but be aware that you have crossed at that point， your early stopping validation
    set to your training。Is what we're going to do is just monitor this。 And as soon
    as that validation set， no longer。Is decreasing and our patience expires。 We're
    going to stop。 We're going to early stop。 I'm going to show you two examples of
    how you will do this。

  zh: 但请注意，你在此时已经将早停法的验证集转换为训练集。我们要做的是监控这一点。当验证集不再减少并且我们的耐心用尽时，我们将停止。我们将提前停止。我将给你展示两个示例，告诉你如何做到这一点。

    The code's mostly the same， but this gives you some good starting point code to
    look at for this。 So for this one， we're going to use the iris data set。 So we

    epoch。 And we set up our neural network， largely just like we did before。It is

    make sure you set it up like that。We're creating a monitor now this is the part
    that does the early stopping。We are telling it that we have a patience of five。

    fit it。 But notice we're giving it X train Y train。 and we're passing in validation
    data。 We haven't done this before。 So the validation data。 The X test Y test versus

    to validation。 So you have X train， X test Y train。 Those are the expected values，
    the Y's。And why test。 So now you have the four measurements split into a train

- en: The random state 42， that just gives us a way to consistently split it。 and
    then the only other thing we do un fit down here is we pass a call back， monitor。
    so that's how this early stopping object that we created actually plugs into the
    training。Or the fit process when we call fit as we train。 So this is how you implement
    early stopping for classification。

  zh: 随机状态42，这只是给我们一个一致拆分的方法。然后我们在这里做的唯一其他事情是传递一个回调，监控。因此这就是我们创建的早期停止对象如何实际插入到训练过程中的方式。当我们调用fit时，它在训练时工作。所以这就是如何为分类实现早期停止。
- en: It's pretty much the same exact process for regression。 You create a monitor。
    you pass it into the callbacks。 and you need to provide validation data。 I just
    give you the exact code for this so that you can quickly make use of it。 By the

    we're trying to predict X is all these other values that we're using to predict
