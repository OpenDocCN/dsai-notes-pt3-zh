- en: Hello， everyone。 My name is Si Chii Yan。 I'm a software engineer at Pytorch
    Model DevX team at Facebook。 Today I'm going to talk about visualizing Pytorch
    model using Tensorboard。Here's the agenda of my talk。 First， I'm going to give
    an overview of the Tensable API。 then dive deep into the API to monitor training
    process and then the API for modelstand tools。

    under development。![](img/b5a4def1dbfd1f8e544809789db7d98b_3.png)

- en: So for overview， we have shipped native support for Tensorboard since Pytorge
    1。2 since then we formed an ongoing close relationship with Google Tensorboard
    team。 So the Tensor API in Pythtor is very easy to use。 You just need to initialize
    the summerwriter and passing the locker representing the directory where you want
    to log your data into。

    can use APIs like At Scalla or add image to load your data。![](img/b5a4def1dbfd1f8e544809789db7d98b_8.png)

- en: The most common use case potentialtensA board is to monitor training process。
    This includes using the Sca API to monitor model learning curve。 QPS or CPU YouTubes
    throughout training。![](img/b5a4def1dbfd1f8e544809789db7d98b_10.png)

- en: You just need to pass in the tag name and the sca value to the Add Sca API。You
    can also。Visualize multiple scala series in the same chart by using the multi
    line chart or the margin chart API。 The histogram API allow us to visualize the
    histogram and distribution of tensors throughout our training。 This includes the
    model weights， activation or gradients。

- en: You just need to pass in the tag name and the tensor value to add histogram
    API。 and then the tensor histogram and distribution will be computed automatically
    unlock to Tensor board。The image MPI allow us to visualize the image training
    samples or the object detection boxes or the images generated from Mapllib or
    Pli throughout training。 for example， people can generate the scatter plot or
    bar chart。

    log through the image API。Tensible also have various other APIs for logging the
    PR curve of a model， text， video， mesh， etc。![](img/b5a4def1dbfd1f8e544809789db7d98b_12.png)

    bottleneck。 You just need to pass in a Pythr model and input tensor。 and then
    the model graph will be generated automatically unlock toten board。![](img/b5a4def1dbfd1f8e544809789db7d98b_16.png)

    and model performance metrics。 and then help us identify the most promising set
    of hyperparmeter。In this example。 we're using parallel colonary view to drill
    down onto some of the most promising runs and identify the common traits of them
    in terms of hyperparameter。The what if2 allow us to visualize large set of examples
    and bucketize them by either the。

    into the model performance or fairness across different segments。It is fully integrated
    with Pytorrch via the custom predict function and Torch serve。 It can be viewed
    both as standalone app or as the Tensoror plugin。

    It will also enable detailed view of model Perf per operator and GPU kernel。The
    ploty plugging will enable us to visualize the ploty figures natively inboard。It
    will offer much better and more interactive user experience。

    plug allows us to monitor certain model metrics across training。And then get alerts
    automatically when they go above or below certain thresholds。 This threshold can
    be either absolute threshold or derivativeive or comparative threshold。
