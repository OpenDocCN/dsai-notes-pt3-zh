    introduction to images， then perform the required installations。🎼Then we will
    learn to read images， videos and webcas。🎼Along with some basic must no open safety
    function。🎼Later， we will learn to resize and crop images。

    into some more advanced topics such as word perspective joining images。Color detection，
    contourward detection， and even face detection。After we have understood the fundamentals，
    we will create three different projects using these core principles。
