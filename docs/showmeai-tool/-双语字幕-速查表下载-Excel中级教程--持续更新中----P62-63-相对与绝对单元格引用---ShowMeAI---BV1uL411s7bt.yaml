- en: In this video， I will explain and demonstrate the differences between relative
    cell references in Excel and absolute cell references in Excel。 And this is a
    very key important concept to understand when using formulas and functions in
    Excel。 And you can see the spreadsheet that I'm using for this video is a mileage
    re sheet。 This tracks each of the employees of a company。 and how many miles they
    drive in their own personal cars。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but doing company business。 And to be fair to those employees。 the company is
    going to reimburse their mileage。 you can see it goes from January through June。
    Okay， first， let's look at relative cell references。 And this really is the most
    common type of cell references that you'll need。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's say the company reimburses mileage twice a year。 So it's halfway through
    the year。 And now we need to calculate the total mileage for the first half of
    the year。 to do that for Kaina。Just click on the cell to the right of her monthly
    mileage totals。 and then just type equals on the keyboard some left parenthesis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then I just need to describe or click and drag to show the range that I
    would like to add up that I would like to sum I'll just click and drag to highlight
    that range。 I should put in a right parenthesis， but it's not necessary in this
    case。 and then I'll tap enter on the keyboard。 and there is the total mileage
    that Kaina has driven in her own personal vehicles for company business。 If you've
    watched my other Excel videos。 you know that I don't have to recreate that formula
    again for epiphonia or Brook or any of these other fine people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead， all I have to do is click on my first formula。 Now it looks like I
    clicked on the number 721 but that's not true。 This cell does not contain the
    number 721。 It contains a formula。 and you can see that here in the formula bar。
    and that formula returns the results7。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So clicking on that cell H3 in this case， I'm going go to the lower right corner
    and click and hold the click on the autofill handle。 or sometimes it's called
    the fill handle。 It's that little square in the lower right corner of the cell。
    I click and hold the click and then drag down to copy that formula all the way
    down。 And there you go。 you can see that it automatically adjusted the formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The autofill handle when I dragged it， it was trying to copy the contents of
    this cell and it succeeded but again。 this cell doesn't have 721 in it。 It has
    this formula。 upon copying and pasting that formula all the way down in column
    H。 Look what exc did。 It automatically adjusted the B3 through G3 part of the
    formula it changed it to B4 through G4 and here B5 through G5 I can also double
    click to show you that B6 through G6 So again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It adjusted the cell references。 The original formula said B3 through G3。 but
    it's adjusting and changing it from B3 through G3 to B8 through G8 or B13 through
    G13 all the way down to B22 through G22 Now that is the default when you use the
    autofill handle it will automatically make those adjustments for you when you
    use the autofill handle Now how is it doing that Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's using relative cell references When I clicked and drag that autofill handle
    Excel by default said okay this formula is relative The original formula is summing
    up the six cells to the left of the current cell So 123456 It's adding up all
    of those to produce the results So when I copied it using the autofill handle
    because it's a relative cell reference the formula that was pasted in said okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will now sum the six cells to the left of the current cell 1，2，3，4，5，6。 and
    it added those up and produced a different number from cell H3。 So that's the
    power and the beauty of relative cell references。 and you don't really have to
    do anything special to specify that you want relative cell references。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the default whenever you use the autofill handle。 So that's exactly what
    I wanted and it's looking good。 So now let's look at absolute cell references。
    and how those can be very important。 Let's say we try the same kind of thing but
    with total amount owed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's say I'm an accountant for this business。 and I need to figure out not
    just the total mileage that each employee drove but how much the company owes
    that person and needs to pay them。 So let's first do it the wrong way using relative
    cell references。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll tap equals to figure out how much the company owes Kaina in this case。
    I need to multiply7。2 and I'll just click on H3， and then I need to multiply it
    by the current reimbursement rate for this company。 Let's say they reimburse 58
    cents for every mile driven。 So I'll put in multiplied by which is just the asterisk
    symbol and then I'll click here on the reimbursement rate and then tap enter wonderful
    it calculates the amount owed to Kaina。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: She drove $721 miles。 that calculates out to being $418 and18 of mileage reimbursement。
    Now here comes the catch。 it seems like that went beautifully。 but when I click
    on the cell that has the formula that I want to copy down to the other employees
    and I use the autofill handle and I pull that down watch what happens。 I release
    and I get all sorts of error messages。 Now in addition to the error messages I
    do get a valid number here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I kind of doubt that the company is going to reimburse this person $435000
    for。Only 1 thousand0 miles。 So what's going on here。 Let's look at the formulas。
    If I double click on this formula， you can see what happened。 The original formula
    was multiplying H3 by I1。 and that was correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let me tap escape on the keyboard to go down and show you the second formula。
    H4 that's correct。 multiplied by I2。 Excel is now trying to multiply by the words
    totalode。 Well。 that doesn't make any sense。 Why did it drop down from the mileage
    reimbursement amount down to totalode。 Well， the answer is very simple。 When you
    use the autofill handle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excel by default is using relative cell references。 And so just like in my total
    mileage example。 Excel is adding1 to the previous formula。 So here the formula
    had I1 So when I clicked and dragged and used the autofill handle。 it shifted
    I1 to being I2。 and then I3。 And so let's look at this formula。 This is another
    good example。H5。 that's this cell。 And that's correct。 That's exactly what I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: multiplied by I 3。 So I 1，2，3 Yikes。 It's multiplying the mileage that this
    person drove by the totalode to Kaina。 That doesn't make any sense at all。 It's
    not even close to being incorrect。 I'll tap escape on the keyboard。 And I'll hold
    control and tap Z a couple of times to undo that mistake。 and I'll tap it one
    more time to undo my incorrect formula。 Even though it worked for Kaina。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It was a failure for all the rest of the employees。 So let's look at the proper
    way to calculate this。 in this formula。 I want the cell reference for total mileage
    to be relative。 But I want the cell reference for mileage reimbursement rate to
    be absolute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want it to stay there no matter what。 So how would I do that。 click on the
    cell where I want to put the formula。 So I type equals。 And now I could click
    here to select H 3。But sometimes it's easier just to type it。 So I'll type H3。
    multiplied by， which is the asterisk。 And now I'll type I。 And then instead of
    just typing1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to type I dollar sign1。 If I don't put that dollar sign in there。
    it will treat this cell reference， I1 as being relative。 And then when I use the
    autofill handle。 it will move away from the mileage reimbursement rate， and I
    need it to stay there。 And so whenever you need a cell reference to stay put no
    matter what to make it absolute What you do is you use an asterisk to tie that
    part of the cell reference down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You're locking it in place。 So I'm locking in place the reference of one。 let's
    try it now。 I tap enter on the keyboard， it returns the same results。 But now。
    when I click and drag using the autofill handle to copy and paste the formula
    for all the rest of the employees。 Look， it worked。 Let's examine the formulas。If
    I double click， you can see it here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can also see it in the formula bar here toward the top。 So there's my original
    formula that I typed。 Let's look at the next one。 H4 multiplied by I sign 1。 What
    about this person。 H5 multiplied by I sign1 So the H is changing H6 H7 H11。 but
    the cell reference in the i column is staying put It's staying at1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Why because I locked it down by using a dollar sign。 Now。 another way to do
    the same thing is to use a dollar sign for both I and1。 So I'm going to click
    here on in this case， cell I3。 and I'll go up to the formula bar。 I very well
    could have put a dollar sign in front of both the I and also sign 1 tap enter
    and if I copy that down now to the rest of the employees。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It doesn't look like it changed anything In reality， it didn't change much。
    But if you look。At each of these individual formulas， you see that there's a dollar
    sign in front of both。 So the only difference there is it locked in the cell reference。
    It locked it in to column I and row number1。 So both are locked in place。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It wasn't necessary to do that because I wasn't dragging this number out of
    I。 right。 I wasn't dragging it over here to J。 or to H。 So there wasn't a need
    to use the dollar sign to lock the cell reference into column I。 but it still
    produces good results。 So the bottom line is with this particular formula that
    I've written。 The H3， that is a relative cell reference。 It changes as I use the
    autofill handle and copy paste that formula down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That H3 changes H5 H 9 etc ce。 But the I1 part of the cell reference。 That is
    an absolute cell reference。 And in this case。 I've chosen to lock down both the
    I and the one。 Those are both going to be riveted to。This cell here I The more
    you use Excel， the more you'll see examples of when it's useful or necessary to
    use absolute cell references。
