- en: In this Microsoft Office tutorialÔºå I'm going to show you a tool that's built
    into many of the common Microsoft Office tools like Word„ÄÇ PowerPoint and Excel„ÄÇ
    And this tool is very usefulÔºå very handy„ÄÇ And what is it„ÄÇ It's the screenshot
    tool„ÄÇ NowÔºå many of you know that most modern Windows computers have a tool called
    the Snipping tool that is a wonderful tool for creating screenshots and adding
    those screenshots to any program that you're using„ÄÇ If you're not familiar with
    the s Snipping tool„ÄÇ watch my tutorial on how to use it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if you're working in Microsoft Office„ÄÇ There's a built in tool that is at
    least one or two steps better than the snipping tool„ÄÇ So let's take a look at
    it in action„ÄÇ Here I am in Microsoft Word And let's say I'mtyping up a report„ÄÇ
    And I decide that I'd like to add something from another software program that
    I have open„ÄÇ Let's say I'd like to take a screenshot of the presentation that„ÄÇI
    have open in PowerPoint„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All I have to do is click here on insert and then choose screenshot and it opens
    up with every window that I currently have open„ÄÇ So here's the PowerPoint presentationÔºå
    Here's Excel and more„ÄÇ So I can simply click„ÄÇ and it takes a screenshot of my
    PowerPoint presentation and it puts it right in my word document„ÄÇ NowÔºå typicallyÔºå
    if you have a browser window openÔºå that should also show up„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you go to insert screenshotÔºå you should also see that browser window and
    you should be able to take a screenshot of it and put it into your document„ÄÇ Now
    that's a great option„ÄÇ It's very handyÔºå very easy„ÄÇ but the downside to it is you
    get a screenshot of the entire windowÔºå the entire screen„ÄÇ So there's another option
    that we have„ÄÇ and that's down here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of simply clicking on an available windowÔºå you can go down and click
    screen clipping„ÄÇ When you do thatÔºå it takes you to whatever window was most„ÄÇRecently
    accessed„ÄÇ and then you can take a screenshot of it„ÄÇ So I'm gonna escape out of
    that and actually not do the screen clipping because that's not the screen clipping
    that I wanted to do„ÄÇ So instead of clicking screenshot screen clipping„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to consider what is it that I want to take a screenshot of„ÄÇ And in this
    case„ÄÇ it is an article on the InternetÔºå this one comes from NASA„ÄÇ and I would
    like a screenshot of this image and the headline and this text„ÄÇ NowÔºå of course„ÄÇ
    it doesn't fit on the screen„ÄÇ But if I hold control on the keyboard and tap minus„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it should shrink it to the point where I can see it all on the screen„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ
    now that this is my most recently accessed window back in Microsoft word„ÄÇ I can
    put the mouse cursor where I want the screen clipping to appear„ÄÇ and then I go
    to screenshot screen clipping„ÄÇ It takes me to my most recently accessed window
    or program„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you can see I get a plus signÔºå and I can then click and drag„ÄÇTo highlight
    exactly what I would like to screenshot or screen clip„ÄÇ And then I just release
    the mouse button„ÄÇ And it puts that screen clipping into my word document„ÄÇ So both
    of these techniques really are excellent„ÄÇ And I think much easier than the snipping
    tool just because they're built right in to Microsoft Office insert screenshot
    or screen clipping„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NowÔºå once you have inserted the screenshot or screen clippingÔºå you can click
    on them„ÄÇYou can rotate themÔºå if you'd like„ÄÇYou can also resize them just the way
    you would typically do with a photo„ÄÇ You can also crop themÔºå if you would like„ÄÇ
    SoÔºå for exampleÔºå in this case„ÄÇ I didn't really want all of the PowerPoint interface
    to show up„ÄÇ So how would I crop this image„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would simply right click on the image and look for an option to crop„ÄÇ And
    here is one„ÄÇ I'll click crop„ÄÇ And I get these black bars„ÄÇ And they're pretty thick
    black bars„ÄÇ And then I can just use those to resize and basically cut out the
    parts of the image that I don't want„ÄÇNowÔºå in order to make this crop effectiveÔºå
    I have to click away from it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and now the photo has been cropped„ÄÇOkayÔºå so we've looked at how this works in
    Microsoft Word„ÄÇ Let's take a look at PowerPoint„ÄÇ in PowerPoint„ÄÇ Can I do the same
    thingÔºå I click on insert„ÄÇ And there we have screenshot„ÄÇ all of my other windows
    appear„ÄÇ and with a click„ÄÇ I have a screenshot„ÄÇ AndÔºå of courseÔºå we also have the
    option to do a screen clipping„ÄÇ Let's try Microsoft Excel„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in Excel„ÄÇ Can I insert a screenshot„ÄÇ UnfortunatelyÔºå in my version of Microsoft
    Excel„ÄÇ I don't see an option for screenshot„ÄÇ NowÔºå I think the reason for this
    is because the size of the screen that I use just doesn't fit all of the options„ÄÇ
    But if I go here to insert illustrations„ÄÇ and I clickÔºå lookÔºå there's screenshot„ÄÇ
    and it works just like before with available windows for me to screenshot and
    screen clipping is also available„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So far so goodÔºå I'm able to use the screenshot tool in WordÔºå PowerPoint and
    Excel„ÄÇ So what about publisherÔºå Let's try that out„ÄÇ if I click insert„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇI don't
    see an option for screenshots in Microsoft Publisher„ÄÇ And as far as I know„ÄÇ it's
    not available„ÄÇ If anyone knows differentlyÔºå if you know of a way to use the screenshot
    tool in Microsoft publisher„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: feel free to put the instructions for it in the description below„ÄÇ So the bottom
    line is with our most commonly used Microsoft Office toolsÔºå Word„ÄÇ Powerpoint and
    Excel„ÄÇ The good news is we can use the built in insert„ÄÇ screenshot tool to screenshot
    an entire windowÔºå or to do a screen clipping of part of the window„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The bad news is it doesn't seem to be available in all office productsÔºå such
    as Microsoft Pub„ÄÇThanks for watching this tutorial„ÄÇ I hope you found it to be
    helpful„ÄÇ If you did„ÄÇ please click the like button below„ÄÇ![](img/c9f198c70a23d98da6f60d5ef6e59dd1_2.png)
