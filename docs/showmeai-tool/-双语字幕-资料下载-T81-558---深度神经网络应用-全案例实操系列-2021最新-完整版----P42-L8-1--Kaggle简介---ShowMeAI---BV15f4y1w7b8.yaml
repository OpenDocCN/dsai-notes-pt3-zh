  zh: 嗨，我是Jeff Heaton。我们在华盛顿大学研究深度神经网络的应用。在这个视频中，我们将概述Cagel。Cagel是竞争性数据科学，课程中的一个项目涉及到Cagggel竞赛，最新的AI课程和项目可以点击旁边的订阅铃铛以接收每个新视频的通知。
- en: Kagel is a big deal in the data science world。 It sort of like the World Cup
    or the Super Bowl in the United States。 It is where data scientists compete with
    each other。 They do this to get kgel rankings。 There's several different kgel
    rankings。 We'll talk about that in a moment。 But what you're going to be the most
    interested in with Cagggel is I'm going to give you a kgel in class。

- en: So this is a special area of kgggel。 It's not a real fullblown kgel competition
    where you're competing with thousands of other data scientists。 but it's using
    exactly the same interface as what Kagel has。 And this lets you get used to the

- en: It's a lot of fun。 I sometimes even have prior students come back and recompte
    in the subsequent kgel competition semesters。 Some students that competed in the
    class kgel competition also went on to do other kgel competitions。 One student
    even got into the top 5% of an actual kle competition which is higher than I've
    ever done in Kaggel So that is cool We'll talk more about what those percentage
    rankings mean in a moment。 So Cagel look at this you can see the top kgel users

    win in kgggel。 our top 10% finish。 These two competitions that I probably did
    the best on in terms of kle。 One was a top 10%。 and one was a top 7% finish。 So

    have female too who should have made it off of the ship but did not。 Nobody knows

- en: Probably the second most important one。 The gender went very much by women and
    children first on a disaster such as this So the most predictive variable here
    is where you male or were you female if you're female you have a much greater
    probability of surviving the second most important depends on if you're male or
    female if you were a female your ticket class had a whole lot to do with it secondarily
    maybe age male very much age was the second most important one because then you
    would fall under the category of children Some of the competitions you will see
    kernels for I won't require that you submit kernels in the class competition that
    we have you can see some of these are ranked fairly high in terms of how good
    of a kernel they are this is where you submit co So there are three different
    ways that you can achieve fame in kegel probably the most prestigious is simply
    by winning competitions are placing very high in competitions The next probably

  zh: 可能这是第二重要的因素。性别在这种灾难中非常依赖“女性和儿童优先”。因此，最具预测性的变量是你是男性还是女性。如果你是女性，你生存的概率要大得多。第二重要的因素取决于你是男性还是女性，如果你是女性，你的票类与此关系密切。其次可能是年龄，男性的年龄也是第二重要的因素，因为那样你会归入儿童的类别。在一些比赛中，你会看到
    kernels，但我不会要求你在我们班的比赛中提交 kernels。你可以看到这些在评价中排名相当高，这是你提交代码的地方。所以在Kaggle中你可以通过三种不同方式获得名声，可能最具声望的就是赢得比赛或在比赛中名列前茅。下一个可能最具声望的就是

  zh: 你不知道哪些行或者公共排行榜，但我有那些Y值。所以Kaaggel会在这方面对你进行评分，并将你放入适合你的公共排行榜分数的组别，然后在最后，Caggle会自动对你在私人排行榜上的表现进行评分。现在准备Caggle提交，你基本上会使用这个测试数据，并填写你所有的答案。对于泰坦尼克号的数据，它的样子是乘客的I，逝者标记为0，幸存者标记为1，这基本上是一个你需要上传的cv文件。我将带你了解一些我发现特别有趣的Caggle比赛。首先，自动组挑战是我参与的第一个比赛，幸运的是我能进入前10%。自动组挑战是一个需要在多个产品类别之间进行区分的比赛。我忘了确切有多少个类别，总共有93个特征，所以是93个X。
- en: Giving 200，000 rows and you need to classify between those this was a very difficult
    kle competition and it was one that I ended up using a combination of deep learning
    and something else called XG boost very much suggest you take a look at XG boostos
    it's outside of the scope of this class but XG boost and something called light
    GBBM are very popular in kle and if you want to ensemble that together with your
    semester kgel assignment that will probably help you get better and higher scores
    for that just to look at the leader board for this one this shows you the people
    who were top ranked Now notice these dots below them is much higher because it
    are real kgel so you had real hardcore competitors competing here the yellows
    are kaggel Grandmas the oranges here or kgel Masters this guy was really lucky
    he just submitted one and got into the top 10 of that one not entirely。

  zh: 提供了200,000行数据，你需要在其中进行分类。这是一个非常困难的Kaggle竞赛，我最终使用了深度学习和其他一种叫XGBoost的方法。我强烈建议你了解一下XGBoost，这超出了本课程的范围，但XGBoost和一种叫LightGBM的技术在Kaggle中非常受欢迎。如果你想将它们与本学期的Kaggle作业结合使用，这可能会帮助你获得更好的分数。只需查看这个案例的排行榜，这显示了排名靠前的人员。现在注意，这些人的底部点数要高得多，因为他们是真正的Kaggle竞争者，而黄色的则是KaggleGrandmasters，橙色的是KaggleMasters。这个人真的很幸运，他只提交了一个案例就进入了前十名，虽然并不是完全。
- en: Sure well， he probably submitted just this one and never competed in Kaaggel
    again。 So he's he's not even at the expert level， but I'm sure he could do that。
    He or she。 this is the public leader board。 So if we this is actually the private
    leader board。 If you look at the public leader board have a look at the top people
    because this is going to flip a little bit。

  zh: 当然，他可能只提交了这一个案例，之后再也没有参与Kaggle竞赛。因此，他甚至不算是专家级别，但我相信他可以做到。他或她。这是公共排行榜。如果我们看一下，这实际上是私人排行榜。如果你查看公共排行榜，可以看看排名靠前的人，因为这会有一些变化。
- en: It didn't actually flip much。 Most of these people were right where they where
    they were。 So there was not much overfitting going on with this one。 Galaxy zoo
    was a pretty interesting one as well。 This is where XG boost really came into
    the limelight。 This is one where you were attempting to classify the type of galaxy
    that you are looking at。

  zh: 实际上并没有太多变化。大多数人的排名基本保持不变。因此，这个案例并没有发生太多过拟合。银河动物园也是一个相当有趣的案例。这是XGBoost真正走入公众视野的地方。这是一个试图分类你所观察到的星系类型的案例。
- en: This was a computer vision one。 This is one of the earlier computer vision ones。
    Kagel has a lot of computer vision ones as well as tabular data where you're dealing
    with rows and columns。 Most of the kagle competitions I've done with this class
    up to this point have been tabular。 but I will will very likely throw in。Computer
    vision1 at some point。

  zh: 这是一个计算机视觉的案例。这是早期计算机视觉中的一个案例。Kaggle上有很多计算机视觉的案例，也有处理行和列的表格数据。我到目前为止在这个课程中参与的大多数Kaggle竞赛都是表格数据，但我很可能会在某个时候加入计算机视觉的案例。
- en: so you' you'll hear about that when we get to the last part of this module and
    we cover what the current semester's competition is The practice fusion one is
    particularly interesting because you're given a relational database This is one
    from the early early days of ks only 1416 in this one This is medical data So
    this is one that my industry the insurance industry has looked at a number of
    times for various examples you're also given ICD9 codes which believe me ICD10
    and IC 9 are big thing in the insurance industry predicting a biological response。

  zh: 所以当我们到达这个模块的最后部分并讨论本学期的竞赛时，你会听到相关信息。实践融合案例特别有趣，因为你会得到一个关系数据库。这是Kaggle早期的一个案例，只有1416个案例。这是医疗数据，因此这是我的行业，保险行业曾多次研究的案例。你还会得到ICD9代码，相信我，ICD10和ICD9在保险行业中是个大问题，涉及预测生物反应。
- en: This was a particularly interesting one。 I give you an example of this one later
    in the module so that I can demonstrate ensembling to you ensembling is where
    you use multiple models together So heterogeneous ensembling that's where you
    might be using a random forest together with a deep neural network compared to
    homogeneous ensembling which is。

  zh: 这是一个特别有趣的例子。我稍后会在模块中给你展示一个例子，以便我可以向你演示集成学习，集成学习是指将多个模型结合在一起。因此，异质集成学习是指将随机森林与深度神经网络结合使用，而同质集成学习则是。
- en: Where you would be using something like a random forest that is doing ensembling
    completely on its own。 If you look at the data dictionary， you get a tremendous
    number of columns。 it has to keep loading them in fact， I think there's over a
    couple thousand and you actually don't even have all that many rows for this one。
    So this is yeah here's the exact stats， the training set you have 3700 rows and
    1777 columns that's kind of crazy but this this was sort of the point of this
    one and you're predicting if a biological response will happen or not。

  zh: 在这里，你会使用随机森林进行完全独立的集成。如果你查看数据字典，会发现有大量的列。实际上，得不断加载，我想这里有几千列，而这一个数据集的行数并不多。所以这里有确切的统计数据，训练集有3700行和1777列，这实在有些疯狂，但这就是这个问题的关键，你要预测生物反应是否会发生。
- en: so it's a binary classification problem。 Some of the computer vision ones that
    I found particularly interesting diabetic retinopathy is very interesting。 This
    is using pictures of your eye called retinopathy to predict if you have diabetes
    or not this is another one。

- en: the insurance industry is obviously quite interested in。 So for $100000。 So
    these are for potential。Big money cats versus dogs。 This is just kind of fun。
    It used to always be said AI fails at telling the difference between a cat and
    a dog that's by no means the case anymore。 This had pictures of cats pictures
    of dogs and you try to use deep learning and other techniques to tell the difference
    between the cat and the dog。

- en: look at the leaderboard。 This is accuracy So somewhere in the area of 99%。 So
    neural networks and other models can very much tell the difference between a cat
    and a dog State farm distracted driver detection。 this is an insurance industry1，

- en: and the idea with a lot of these is you let the insurance company put some sort
    of monitoring device in you。 This is completely IoT Internet of things So there's
    something in these cars that are tracking these people and they're taking pictures
    of these people as they're driving。

  zh: 这些想法的核心是让保险公司在你身上放置某种监控设备。这完全是物联网（IoT）。所以这些车里有些东西在追踪这些人，并在他们开车时拍照。
- en: Iea is if you demonstrate that you're a safe driver or a healthy individual
    whatever。 the insurance company will give you a lower premium。 These are drivers
    who are not so safe。 You can see she's looking at a cell phone。's looking at least
    out of the car but has a cell phone in hand So you would want to detect if they're
    doing a safe activity or a not so safe activity。 There's also time series in kgel
    the whale detection challenge was very interesting。

  zh: 我的意思是，如果你证明自己是安全驾驶者或健康个体，保险公司会给你更低的保费。这些是驾驶不太安全的人。可以看到，她在看手机，至少看起来是出车外，但手里却拿着手机。所以你需要检测他们是在进行安全活动还是不太安全的活动。还有时间序列，Kaggle的鲸鱼检测挑战非常有趣。
- en: you're looking at basically sound waves。 So processing sound files。 This is
    a very popular thing for time series data like LSTms and some of the new convolution
    temporal stuff。 we'll talk more about that as we get into time series and then
    other Kagel always has helping Santa's helpers and this is just a bizarre competition

- en: Ens up becoming quite bizarre because off these competitions for Santa will
    the schedules for Santa will go on for many。 many decades after Christmas。 So
    he ends up very， very late。 But this is an optimization problem。 A little bit
