    we're going to be talking about context filters and how you can use them to improve
    the performance of your dashboard。 as well as how they impact what is displayed
    on particular sheets To do that。 we're going to connect to the superstore data
    set using the orders sheet。😊。

- en: Then we're going to go to sheet one。And we're going demonstrate this very simply，
    just using。I category， I'm sorry。 we're going to put category on the filters shelf。
    We're going to select all of those。 Then we're going to take subcatego and put
    subcatego on the row shelf。

- en: And then we're going to take our sales and put it on the cons shelf。 So we have
    a nice list。 I like to sort this too。 Just going do it descending by the sum of
    the sail。 So we get a nice。 neat looking graph。 Now， say we only wanted the top  five
    subcategories to display in our visualization。 We can do that very easily by just
    applying a filter to the subcategory setting it to be the top  five by sales。

- en: We the sum of sales clicking O。 And now you can see we have our top five categories，
    but。That's a little bit of a challenge。 So if we show the category filter。 you
    can see we have three top categories for our all of our subcategories。 And if
    we take these。In and out。You'll note that our top 5 is no longer a top 5。 It's
    sometimes a top 3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We can even take it down to a top 1 because it's filtering out each of the categories。But
    not actually replacing the items， the subcategories with items from other categories。
    And the reason it's doing that is because the way tableau processes a top 5 filter
    is it takes everything。From the database calculates the top five， in this case，
    the top five subcategories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then applies the filters after it's already calculated what the top  five
    are。 So every time we remove a category， we just remove those items from the top
    5。 and we get the top5 as they are without that category， which in this case，
    is only a top 3。What context filters do is context filters change the order。In
    which it happens so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Everything else will only be applied now that we've turned this into a context
    filter rate。 So you just click that and then click add to context。Everything that
    we do now is only going to be applied to data that has already passed through
    that category filter。 So what that means in the grand scheme of things is that
    when we uncheck one of these categories。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， if we uncheck furniture。We still have a top 5。 we have the top  five
    excluding anything from the furniture category。 because that furniture data didn't
    pass through our context filter。And our top 5 is being calculated on only the
    data that we have left。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: why is this particularly important well。Obviously， it helps with the top fives。
    But beyond that。 if you use this on your dashboards， particularly in ones where
    you're struggling for performance。 because each filter now has to be calculated
    on fewer values because now we don't have any data from furniture flowing through。
    we only have office supplies and technology。That will speed up the processing
    of any subsequent filters that you have after the context filter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It will also help speed up any calculations or anything like that。 And this
    can have a significant impact on how your。Visualizations， how your dashboards
    perform。 The other thing that it will do is it will。Only show。Values that make
    sense in the other filters。 so。If we look at our filter for subcategory now， So
    we'll show the filter， you will see that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever we add or remove things。Then only values that make sense will show
    up in hour。Subcate filter。So there you go。 So that about does it for this episode
    of Tableau in  two minutes。 Go ahead and give context filters a try。 Let us know
    how they work for are you。 If you have any questions， please leave them in the
    comments。 As always。
