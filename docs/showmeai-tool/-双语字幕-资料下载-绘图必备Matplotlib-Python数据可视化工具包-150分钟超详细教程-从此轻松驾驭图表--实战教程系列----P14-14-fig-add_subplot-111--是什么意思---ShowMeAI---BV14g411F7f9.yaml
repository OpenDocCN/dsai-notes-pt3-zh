- en: Okay， moving on。 So a very common question。Very common question。 And this is
    something that we didn't actually。We did not。Y。😔，This method this way。 But you
    might see something like this what。The heck does this mean。Um。You might see Fig
    dot add subplot， something like 1，1，1。

- en: So what the heck does that mean， Well， let's just try it and see what happens。
    So we'll do fig x equals well， you know， actually。Yeah， yeah。 we'll do this。 So
    PL T dot subpls。And then Fig dot add subplot 11，1。 Let's try that， PL T do show。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_3.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this will actually be a little bit more clear。If we take away our axes。 So
    let's create a figure。 Let's a figure first。 So fig equals Pl T dot fig your。But
    let's not create an axes to start。 and I'm not going to use this add subplot either。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_5.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So。WithWith just creating a figure and then doing PLT。how。You see that we have
    a figure here。 but there are no axes and remember that the axes are where the
    plots actually occur。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_7.png)
  prefs: []

- en: '![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_8.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So we don't have anything that we can do any plotting on。So if you have a figure
    and you want to add an axes to it。 that's where this add subplot command comes
    in。 So now if I set A x equal to this and we we run this。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_10.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll see that now we have an axes。 And if， you know， just to be very explicit
    about it。 let's print a X and you'll see that this is an axes subplot type。 We
    can even just print the。The type of this object。And this is of type， mapplot Lib，
    axes， subplots， axy subplot。So basically。 what add subplot does。Is it adds an
    axes to the figure。 So that's kind of。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's kind of step 1 here。 So I'， I'll say， you know， first。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_12.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Fig dot add subplot。Adds in axes to an existing。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_14.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Figure。So then there's a question about what does this 111 thing mean？So I will
    admit this is。 this is very confusing。 Let's just look at the documentation for
    subplot。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_16.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And once again， kind of unhelpfully， we just have these as quarks here。 but
    let's let's look at the call signature。 This is where the useful information is
    going to be。 So add subplot。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_18.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It looks like you have different options for using the add subplot method。 and
    you do， in fact。 So the first way you can call it。Is how many rows do you want，
    How many columns do you want。 And then what's the index of this plot。 So let's
    use that really quickly。 So imagine that I say。 I want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_20.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: I want two rows。I want three columns。And this is going to be at index number。
    let's say。 index number 2。So it's hard to see。 Okay， let's。Get did it。Let's create
    a basic axes to work with。First， so we'll do dot subplots here， and then we'll
    create a second axes on top of it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: There we go。So。This。Hopefully， this makes a little bit of since。 So essentially
    what we're saying is we're creating our first axes， which is this graph back here。And
    then add subplot。We are going to imagine that we're creating。That we're creating
    two rows and three columns worth of subplots。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and we're going to only create an axes at index number 2。So let's say that we
    wanted to demonstrate this a little bit more clearly。 Let's also add。 let's say
    axes number 3。 And we're going to add this at index。 Let's say 1，2，3。 let's say
    add it at 4。 So we're going to add it in this bottom corner here。And there you
    go。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So add subplot is basically a way of saying， hey， I have a figure。I want to
    create an axes on it。And。 and I want it to be in this specific location。 And I
    want it to appear as if it's in you know。 a row of， of two rows，3 columns， et
    cetera。 So that's kind of one of the ways that we can use it here。 going back
    to the documentation。

- en: You'll see that we also can pass in just pose or X， so let's take a look at
    what those are。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_27.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_28.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: So POS pose position。Is a three digit integer where the first digit is the number
    of rows。 The second is the number of columns， and the third is the index。 So this
    is why I think this is kind of confusing because you can basically take these
    methods。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_30.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And just squish them down with no commas。And this is exactly the same thing。So
    we're saying， hey。 I want to create。Subpls as if there were two rows and three
    columns。 and I want to create create an axes at index2。 We run this。 We get the
    exact same thing。So if you see something like Fig。 add subplot， 111。Well， what
    does that mean。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: '![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_32.png)'
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Well。Let's go back。To just creating our figure。Figure。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_34.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All right。So fig dot add subplot。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_36.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Subpl 1，1，1。 So this is saying I want one row。I want one column。 and then I
    want to create an axes at index 1 within this thing。 So this is basically saying
    I want one graph， you know。Nothing too tricky there。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_38.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And actually， this is the exact same as calling it。With no arguments there。
    So I think this whole thing can be rather confusing personally。Whenever you have
    the option to create subplots in the very beginning here。![](img/5f2ab3c17c0f8a480827c5087baec5a2_40.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Whenever this makes sense for you。I would say do it this way。 do it this way。
    And then you get your list of axes objects there。 and then you can， you know。
    you can manipulate them individually that way。 If you really like using this way，
    that's fine。 But just know that there are， there are kind of a lot of different
    ways that you can do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I it can get very confusing。 So try to pick one way and stick with it。 And I
    would recommend if you。 I would recommend just sticking with this to begin with。And
    by the way。 just to show you that we can， in fact， plot on those axes。Just like
    we would plot on any other axises。 I'm going to do A X equals fig dot add subpl。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: A X dot plots。 Let's do X and Y。 Let's create another one。 A X 2 equals fig
    dot add subplots。 Let's create two rows，3 columns。 We'll do index3 this time。And
    then A X 2 dot plot X。Wai。😔。And there you go。 We got our big graph， which is this
    first one that we created。 and we got our small graph， which is that second one
    that we created。
