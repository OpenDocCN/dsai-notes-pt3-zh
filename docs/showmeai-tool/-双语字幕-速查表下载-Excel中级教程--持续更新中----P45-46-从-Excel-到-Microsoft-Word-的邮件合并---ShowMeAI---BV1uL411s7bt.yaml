- en: In this videoÔºå I will show you how to do a mail merge from Microsoft Excel to
    Microsoft Word„ÄÇ And let me show you what I mean by that Here I have a form letter
    that I've written up for a hypothetical small business„ÄÇ and it's just about ready
    to be sent out to all of my business contacts„ÄÇ But you see that some aspects of
    the form letter need to be customized„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Instead of saying dear recipient nameÔºå I want the actual person's name to be
    inserted there„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ the recipient's company name„ÄÇ their address and other details„ÄÇ
    I have contact information here in Microsoft Excel„ÄÇ These are my business contacts
    with names„ÄÇ company nameÔºå addressÔºå et cetera„ÄÇ And the good news is that by using
    mail merge„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't have to recreate this form letter 50 times once for each of my contacts„ÄÇ
    Instead„ÄÇ I can simply pull the important data from this Excel spreadsheet„ÄÇ Let's
    look at how to do that„ÄÇ So step 1 is to take a close„ÄÇüòäÔºåLook at the Excel spreadsheet
    with the contact information„ÄÇ In my caseÔºå this is a spreadsheet that I have customized
    and I've created from scratch and added to and been pretty careful with„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've organized it the way I want it to be organized„ÄÇ But in your case„ÄÇ you might
    be exporting this data from another program or another source„ÄÇ And so the first
    thing you need to do is make sure that your Excel data is in good shape„ÄÇ For exampleÔºå
    it really helps to have a header row„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see row number one for me has column headings„ÄÇ This is gonna to be very
    helpful when doing a mail merge„ÄÇ Each of these header names will basically become
    a placeholder in my Microsoft Word document„ÄÇ Another thing you might consider
    isÔºå do you want the business addresses or the contact addresses to be split up
    like this„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see I've got the street address hereÔºå the cityÔºå the state and zip code
    all separated out„ÄÇ NowÔºå in your caseÔºå it may not be necessary to do that„ÄÇ It might
    be okay just to keep„ÄÇThe entire address together in one column„ÄÇ there are pros
    and cons„ÄÇ But just be aware that if you want to change itÔºå it's best to do it
    before the mail merge„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sam with names„ÄÇ Do you really want first name and last name separated out„ÄÇ It
    should be okay„ÄÇ but you just want to try to make sure that your data is ready
    to be merged into word„ÄÇ I'm satisfied with this data„ÄÇ So I'll go ahead at this
    point„ÄÇ I'm going to just exit out of this documentÔºå In factÔºå I want to save itÔºå
    and then exit„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then the data will be ready to be pulled into Microsoft Word„ÄÇ NowÔºå back
    in Microsoft word„ÄÇ All I have to do to customize my form letter for each recipient
    in that Excel spreadsheet is use this mailings tab„ÄÇ So I'll click on mailings
    and it opens up the mailings ribbon„ÄÇ And here toward the left„ÄÇ notice it says
    start mail merge„ÄÇ And it's tempting to just click that start mail merge button„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: InsteadÔºå thoughÔºå I need to first select recipients„ÄÇ This gives me three options„ÄÇ
    I could pull my„ÄÇFrom my outlook contacts that's definitely a good option„ÄÇ If you
    use Microsoft Outlook a lot„ÄÇ you can also click here to type a new list„ÄÇ I could
    go in and type in contact information for all 62 people that I want to mail this
    to„ÄÇ but that's gonna be a lot of work and it's unnecessary in this case„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll cancel out the option I really want to use is the second one Use existing
    list So I click there„ÄÇ and hopefully I know where I stored that Excel spreadsheet
    In my case I stored it on the desktop so I can just click there„ÄÇ and there is
    my contact list for the mail merge In your case you may need to browse your documents
    you may need to search your computer in order to find where you stored the source
    spreadsheet„ÄÇ but there it is for meÔºå I'll just double click on it to open it up„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And now Microsoft Word is just trying to verify what part of that Excel workbook
    do I want to use for my recipient source„ÄÇ And in this caseÔºå there's only one option
    sheet number one my Excel„ÄÇContacts list only has one spreadsheet that has data„ÄÇ
    And so word figured out„ÄÇ that's probably the1 I want„ÄÇ And it is„ÄÇ It's important
    to also notice this checkbox in the lower left corner„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: First row of data contains column headers„ÄÇ If you remember„ÄÇ I said it's easier
    to do a mail merge if you have column headersÔºå which I do in my spreadsheet„ÄÇ So
    I need to make sure that that is checked and then click O„ÄÇ NowÔºå when I clicked
    okay„ÄÇ it looked like nothing happened„ÄÇ But if you were watching closely„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you may have noticed that some of these buttons changed a little bit„ÄÇ They look
    a little different„ÄÇ Many of them were grayed out like this„ÄÇ but now are not„ÄÇ And
    one of the changes is this notice that there's now edit recipient list„ÄÇ Now that
    I've selected my recipient listÔºå I can go in and click edit and you can see all
    of the names that were in sheet one of my workbook in Excel are now included here
    in my recipient list„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NowÔºå what if I want to send this form letter to everybody on this list except„ÄÇFor
    Lana„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ I can just uncheck her name„ÄÇ What if I want to send it to everyone
    except for people that live in one particular state„ÄÇ WellÔºå I can click filterÔºå
    and I can filter out based on the state that the contact lives in or based on
    any of these other things„ÄÇ zip code maybe notice that you can also sortÔºå which
    really shouldn't make that much difference„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if you want toÔºå you can sort your list of recipients„ÄÇ You can also look
    for duplicates„ÄÇ and you can even try to validate the addresses to make sure that
    their real addresses„ÄÇ So there's lots of great options here„ÄÇ I'm going to put
    Lana back into the list of recipients„ÄÇ and I'll click O„ÄÇ OkayÔºå now I'm ready to
    begin identifying where I want information from Excel to be pulled into Microsoft
    word„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this information here in the upper left is information about my fictional
    small business„ÄÇ So I don't need that to change based on who the recipient is„ÄÇ
    But this„ÄÇ I do need to change the recipient name„ÄÇAnd if you look belowÔºå there's
    another recipient name„ÄÇ So I'm going to highlight all of thatÔºå including the comma„ÄÇ
    That's what I'd like to replace„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now on the mailings tabÔºå mailing's ribbon here in the right an insert fields
    group„ÄÇ Notice that there is a greeting line button„ÄÇ If I click on that„ÄÇ it makes
    it really easy to customize this„ÄÇ So I can say DeÔºå so and so or twoÔºå so and so„ÄÇ
    or just leave out the Deer or two„ÄÇ I think I'll leave it with Dear„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    bit too much„ÄÇ Maybe I just want the last nameÔºå Mr„ÄÇ RndallÔºå or maybe I would want
    to just use the first name„ÄÇ And then I get to decideÔºå do I want a comma or a semicolon
    or nothing after the dear Joshua in this case„ÄÇ And nextÔºå look at thisÔºå it says
    greeting line for invalid recipient names„ÄÇ So from time to time„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

- en: there's an error„ÄÇ if there is an errorÔºå what do I want the default message to
    be„ÄÇ And this is it„ÄÇDear sir or ma'amÔºå But there are other options here as well„ÄÇ
    NowÔºå look what we have below that„ÄÇ This is great„ÄÇ It's a preview to make sure
    that what I'm doing is going to work„ÄÇ So dear Lana„ÄÇ dear EllisÔºå De DouglasÔºå for
    the most partÔºå these seem to be first names„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it seems to be working really well„ÄÇ So I can browse through quite a few
    of these in just a preview„ÄÇ NowÔºå if I notice some problems„ÄÇ You knowÔºå maybe it
    says dear Texas or dear LouisianaÔºå in that case„ÄÇ I could tell that there was a
    problem„ÄÇ In order to fix thatÔºå all I have to do is go to match fields„ÄÇ And this
    shows me how Microsoft word is trying to figure out the data from Excel„ÄÇHere at
    the left„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: word gives me some common data fields that are in form letters„ÄÇ And then here
    at the right„ÄÇ these are the column headings from my source from my Excel workbook„ÄÇ
    So it matched first name to first name„ÄÇ Last name to last name„ÄÇ But a lot of these
    other things aren't matched„ÄÇ And it's probably okay„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't need to have something for every possible field„ÄÇ But if there is a mistake„ÄÇ
    I can correct that here„ÄÇ for nowÔºå I'll just click O and click O„ÄÇ NowÔºå notice what's
    happened„ÄÇ Microsoft word has put greeting line right here„ÄÇ Now that it's there„ÄÇ
    I don't need to keep this original wording or text„ÄÇ So I can highlight it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tap delete or backspace on the keyboard„ÄÇ And that one part of my form letter
    is now ready„ÄÇSo it looks like the rest of the letter looks good„ÄÇ But up at the
    topÔºå if you recall„ÄÇ I want to have the recipient's name again here„ÄÇ and then the
    rest of this information„ÄÇ So just like before I'm going to highlight recipient
    nameÔºå you don't actually have to do that„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just find it a useful way to approach the task„ÄÇ But anywayÔºå I highlight recipient
    name„ÄÇ This time„ÄÇ it's not quite a greeting line„ÄÇ So insteadÔºå I'm going to select
    this„ÄÇ insert merge field„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ for some reasonÔºå it's grayed out„ÄÇ I can't use it„ÄÇ
    I've noticed that whenever this happens„ÄÇ I can just click away from my selected
    textÔºå and then just triple click on it fast„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And sometimes that works„ÄÇ but look what it did„ÄÇ Now I can select insert merge
    field„ÄÇ When I click itÔºå it gives me a list of all of the pieces of data from my
    Excel worksheet„ÄÇ You should recognize this„ÄÇ So I'll go with first name„ÄÇ I'll click
    insert and last name„ÄÇ and I'll click insert„ÄÇ and then I can click close„ÄÇ Now that
    I've got those in there„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can delete company name„ÄÇ NowÔºå I've left out one little step„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇBut I want to
    save that for a little bit later and highlight it„ÄÇ So next„ÄÇ I'll move on to street
    address„ÄÇ I'll select the street address and the city state zip code„ÄÇ all of it„ÄÇ
    It's all highlightedÔºå and I'll come up here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I could go here again to insert merge field„ÄÇ and I could piece together
    each aspect of an address„ÄÇ or notice that there is a specific button for address
    block„ÄÇ So I can just click there„ÄÇ and it gives me a preview„ÄÇ Ellen Hawkins Chinotic
    music and here's the address„ÄÇ And I can cycle through my previews just by clicking
    these buttons here at the right and also at the left„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NowÔºå the more I look at thisÔºå the more I can see that there's a problem„ÄÇ The
    address is missing the street address„ÄÇ It's just got the cityÔºå state and zip code„ÄÇ
    So similar to what I showed you earlierÔºå I can go here to match fields„ÄÇ And I'm
    going to take a look at address„ÄÇ address 1 not matched„ÄÇ So here's the problem„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All I have to do is click the arrow and select business address in my„ÄÇüòäÔºåCase

    if that fixes it„ÄÇ Stephanie Ba Sth CityÔºå there's the street address„ÄÇ there's the
    city state and zip code„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

    mail merge„ÄÇ Not here at the leftÔºå you can customize how the name is displayed„ÄÇ
    You can also choose to take out the company name if you don't want it included„ÄÇ
    I do want it„ÄÇ and there are other options as well that you can try„ÄÇ I'm happy
    with how this looksÔºå I'll click O„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

    I want to click preview results„ÄÇ If you recallÔºå I said I had missed a step or

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's no space between the word Stephanie and the word ball„ÄÇ NowÔºå in this
    preview results mode„ÄÇ you can just go in and fix the mistake„ÄÇ So let's try that„ÄÇ
    Now that I've put a space between Stephanie and ball„ÄÇ If I go up and click the
    next arrow to look at the next recipient„ÄÇ LookÔºå it's fixed for genie„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    of the nice things about the preview results„ÄÇ Turn it on and then make your changes„ÄÇ
    Now you can turn it off„ÄÇ It's a toggle so you can go back and forth„ÄÇ and I could
    have made the same change hereÔºå outside of preview mode„ÄÇ I could have put in a
    space„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: OkayÔºå but the larger problem is the name is repeated twice„ÄÇ When I set up the
    address block„ÄÇI didn't think twice about itÔºå but notice it is going to insert
    the recipient's name again„ÄÇ So I don't need that first name at all„ÄÇ So I'll highlight
    itÔºå delete„ÄÇ And just like before„ÄÇ I can preview and see that it will fix it for
    all of the recipients„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and you'll notice it's changing the data here and here and anywhere else that
    I've inserted a merge field from Microsoft Excel„ÄÇ If you'd likeÔºå you can click
    check for errors„ÄÇ and you can see the three options there„ÄÇ but in my caseÔºå I can
    tell that this is working exactly the way I want it to work„ÄÇ So I'll click finish
    and merge„ÄÇ And that gives me three optionsÔºå I can edit individual documents„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This would create basically 62 different separate documents one for each person
    that I'm gonna mail this to„ÄÇ I could also send email messages that include this
    document„ÄÇ And notice what it did„ÄÇ It's pulling automatically from my source Excel
    spreadsheet„ÄÇ It found that I had a column heading named email address and it automatically„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    settings and then just click OK and it should open up outlook„ÄÇ and I'll be able
    to send an email to each of these people„ÄÇ In my caseÔºå though„ÄÇ I just want to print
    the documents„ÄÇ so I can click print And so even though this is just one page„ÄÇ
    you can see it down here in the lower left page one of one„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    62 different times one for each record that I merged from Microsoft Excel„ÄÇ and
    I can just click O select my printer and click O and it will print out one at
    a time„ÄÇ At this pointÔºå if I think I might use this document again„ÄÇ It's a good
    idea to go here to the file tab and save a copy of this document so I can easily
    bring it up„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    I want you to see that there's also an option to do this same kind of thing with
    envelopes„ÄÇ I can set up and„ÄÇEnWith a mail merge and customize that envelope so
    that it can also be printed along with my form letter„ÄÇ If there's interest in
    thisÔºå I'd be happy to create another tutorial that reviews some of these steps
