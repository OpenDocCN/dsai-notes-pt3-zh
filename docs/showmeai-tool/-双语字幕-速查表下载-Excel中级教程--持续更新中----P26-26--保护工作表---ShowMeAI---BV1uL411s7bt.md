In this short video tutorialÔºå I'm going show you an advanced Excel technique called Pro sheet„ÄÇ And at this pointÔºå I hope that you've watched my beginner's guide to using Excel and also my intermediate Excel tips and tricks„ÄÇ for the advanced stuff„ÄÇ I'm just creating short videos„ÄÇ So please check out my other Excel advanced videos when you have time„ÄÇ in this videoÔºå though„ÄÇ

 we're gonna look at how to protect a sheet„ÄÇ So I have here a sample sheetÔºå and it's pretty small„ÄÇ but it's basically a list of amazing musicÔºå some of which you've probably heard of„ÄÇ and others that are more underground or lesser known„ÄÇ And if you're interested in learning about some of this amazing music„ÄÇ

 I'll put some links in the description below so that you can click and learn about the music that should be worldfam that isn't always so anyway„ÄÇ let's say I'm going trust this spreadshe to someone else„ÄÇ maybe my son or my daughter is gonna go in„ÄÇ and I want them to update the value of my C D collection„ÄÇ AndÔºå of courseÔºå this is„ÄÇüòäÔºåJust a small sample of the collection„ÄÇ But anyway„ÄÇ

 let's say I want them occasionally to update the valueÔºå the current value of each of these Cs„ÄÇ but I'm afraid that they might accidentally delete some of this data„ÄÇ this data took me a while to put in there and I want to protect it so that they can only change the current value of each item„ÄÇ but they can't ruin the whole record So how would I go about doing this„ÄÇ WellÔºå it's kind of tricky„ÄÇ

 and you almost have to think backwards in order to figure out how to do this„ÄÇ What you need to do is click and drag to select the cells that I want to be editable These are the cells that I want to be editable everything else I would like to be protected and locked but these I want to be editable so I select those cells that range and of course I could go much further as well„ÄÇ

 And then I go here to the home tab home ribbon and the font group launch button NowÔºå honestly„ÄÇ I could have picked any of these launch buttons butm„ÄÇClick this oneÔºå the font launch button„ÄÇ and it opens up with some optionsÔºå one of which is protection„ÄÇ There's a protection tab„ÄÇ So I click on it and notice that it says that those cells that I've selected are locked„ÄÇ by default„ÄÇ

 all cells in Excel are locked„ÄÇ But they don't seem to be locked to do they„ÄÇ The reason why is because in order to actually activate this and make them actually be locked„ÄÇ you have to follow these steps that are listed here„ÄÇ But in this case„ÄÇ this is the range that I don't want to be locked„ÄÇ So I'm going uncheck that option„ÄÇ Click okay„ÄÇ

 And now those are set up to be unlocked„ÄÇ Everything else is set up to be locked„ÄÇ So now to actually activate it to put the layer of protection over this sheet so that indeed„ÄÇ these are unlocked and everything else is locked„ÄÇ What I have to do is one more step„ÄÇ I have to go to the review tabÔºå the changes group and notice that there's an option to protect the sheet„ÄÇ

 So just with a click„ÄÇIt brings up this optionÔºå protect the sheet and the contents of locked cells„ÄÇ If I want toÔºå I can password protect this so that students or other people can't just go here to review and unprotect the sheet„ÄÇ I could password protected„ÄÇ I'm going click okay„ÄÇ And so now it's protected„ÄÇ This sheet is protected„ÄÇ notice what happens when I try to type over the words new wave„ÄÇ

 it doesn't let me when I try to type over one of the dates„ÄÇ it doesn't let me those areas are locked„ÄÇ But the part that I set to be unlocked„ÄÇ The value„ÄÇ let's say the value goes up on some of these CdsÔºå which often happens„ÄÇ I can click and change those because those cellsÔºå I change them from being defaulted to locked to be unlocked„ÄÇ

 So this is a way to protect a sheet that you're a little concerned that maybe you're sharing with others and you're afraid that maybe they'll change the wrong data accidentally or on purpose„ÄÇ and yet you want them to be able to work in certain areas of the sheet„ÄÇ
