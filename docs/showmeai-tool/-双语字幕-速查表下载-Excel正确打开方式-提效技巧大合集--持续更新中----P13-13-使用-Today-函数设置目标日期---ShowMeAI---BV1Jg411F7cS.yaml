- en: In this tutorial， I'm going to show you an Excel function。 and that function
    is the today function。 Let's look at how it works。 I've got a spreadsheet here
    that we'll be using in just a minute。 but for now， I'm just going to go down in
    the lower right corner and zoom in a little bit。 I'd like to get to about 1070%。
    and I'll just click in a cell。 let's say cell B3。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'll just type equals。 So this cell equals today。 and then all you have
    to do is type a left parenthesis and a right parenthesis。 and then tap enter or
    return on your keyboard。 and it gives you today's date。 So thinking about this，
    how could this be useful。 Well， maybe you'll be printing your spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And every time you print， you want to know what day it was when you printed
    it。 You want a record of that。 You could just make a cell that has this function
    and formula in it and then go ahead and print and the date will always be printed
    there。 So that's just one example。 There are many situations。In which using the
    today function would be useful。 But just for fun， I've put in some holidays here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'd like it to automatically generate how many days until those holidays。
    Now。 I hope that you'll see that you could also use this for other things。 maybe
    there's a target date coming up。 an event that's approaching that your team is
    looking forward to or working toward you could do the same kind of thing。 So the
    first thing I'm gonna do is delete this。 We don't need that sitting there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And let's say this spreadsheet has all sorts of other data already on it。 I
    wouldn't want to interfere with the data that's already there。 So what I'm gonna
    do is I'm gonna go down here to the lower left corner。 click the plus sign to
    get sheet number two。 And again， I'll zoom in a bit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'll just put in my formula here equals today left and right parentheses
    hit enter or return。 So that's always going generate today's date every time I
    open the spreadsheet。 And then I'll click here on B and I'll type in the date
    for Halloween。 So there it is And now all I have to do is go back to。Sheheet1
    and click here in cell E2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'll type equals。 So this cell equals， and then I'll just click here on
    sheet2 in the lower left。 it equals this date and notice what is entered here
    on the formula bar。 It's just put the cell reference from sheet 2。 So this cell。
    and then I'll just click up there and type minus this cell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then I'll tap enter or return on the keyboard。 there are 26 days until Halloween。
    Now I can easily do the same thing for Thanksgiving giving Christmas and New Year's
    Day。 As far as my formula up here is concerned。 all I have to do is click on it
    and then click on the lower right corner and use the autofill handle to click
    and drag and copy this formula down all the way to4。 But now I need to enter the
    dates for these three additional holidays。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So give me a minute to do so and then I'll resume the video。 Allright。 you can
    see that I've entered all of those dates for the upcoming holidays。 Now I can
    just go to sheet。1， and repeat the process that I did up here for Halloween。 Just
    click type equals， and then go to sheet2。 It equals Thanksgiving Day minus today's
    date。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: tap enter， Sam for Christmas。 This cell is equal to sheet2 Christmas day。 And
    then I go up here to the formula bar。 minus today's date， enter and New Year's
    Day。 This cell is equal to sheet 2， New Year's Day， minus today's date。 tap enter。
    And now I have a built in tracker， letting me know how many days until certain
    exciting target dates。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And the way I've set this up。 these target dates are set in sheet2。 And that
    way it's separate away from the data that I'll be using on a day to day basis
    here in this spreadsheet。 So I hope that you'll identify ways that you can use
    this。 maybe add it to your spreadsheets。 letting you know when something is due。Maybe
    it could be a reminder for when certain data needs to be posted or certain goals
    need to be accomplished。
