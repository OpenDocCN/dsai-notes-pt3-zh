- en: Hi， this is Jeffhein。 welcome to applications of deep neural networks with Washington
    University in this video we're going to look at GANs。 which are pairs of neural
    networks that are called generative adversarial neural networks You have a neural
    network that is generating images and another neural network that is trying to
    determine if those images are fake or real。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it doesn't have to be images it can be really any type of data。 We'll see
    several types of data in this course for the latest on my AI course and projects
    click subscribe and the bell next to it to be notified of every new video so let's
    talk about GganNs。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: GANs stand for generative adversarial neural network This is really two neural
    networks that work together to produce a highly realistic image or other type
    of data So this person that you're looking at here is completely fake they don't
    exist they were created by a GAN that studied on many。

- en: If you want to just play with this technology go to this person doesnotexist
    com。 This is the website that I'm using to generate this Later in this course。
    I'll show you how to use exactly the same technology that these guys are using
    on this website and how you can generate your own completely using your own computer
    or using Google coleb you do need a GPU to actually run stylegan well unless you
    make some modifications to it let's talk a little bit about how you can tell one
    of these fakegan images if you look at this person first of all the most obvious
    thing is always look to the background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's a bit surreal looking if you look at the background to one of these images
    it looks at first glance realistic but if you closely examine it much like a dream
    it's not real going on in here maybe that's some sort of marble background she's
    standing in front of there's also kind of a line here with a harsh change from
    one side to the other so that is definitely something to look for too。

- en: And look at their clothing， look for like the shoulders， so where's her shoulders。
    wheres it's it's not necessarily。Liing up， this is also too usually the headshot
    that you'll see from one of thesegans right up to the neck because they don't
    want to get the clothing too involved because that's that's a lot more difficult
    for the for the G to be dealing with。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: not that some of the newer algorithms aren't aren't doing that。 I've seen Gs
    that are doing entire body shots now。 but let's refresh and see a few other faces
    because this is really what the Gs are particularly well known for。 Now， this
    one， the background is pretty solid color and a little photoshopping and you could
    rip out the G background。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，And sub in a different， a different background。 Now this speaks more to photoshopping
    skills。 but you can see these hair that that blend in with the background。 somebody
    is not doing too good of a job with Photoshop。 they'll clip that right off and
    the hair will look very additional strands of it going into the background。

- en: We'll go through another thing too， is ears are very often not as symmetric
    as you would expect。 and especially if they have earrings See if I can find somebody
    with an earring。Often the earring on each side will be completely different so
    let's take a look at what this technology actually is GNs were introduced by Ian
    Goodfellow in 2014 and this is this is a technology that has really taken deep
    learning by by storm the first paper and 2014 did some fairly basic faces both
    with convolution neural networks and without this has been taken a lot further
    than just the images of digits that were generated and。

- en: The fairly simple faces from the Toronto faces data set that Ian Goodfellow
    first worked with he also generated images and pictures from the CR data sets。
    you get kind of。Surreal ghostly looking images of some of the the dogs and cats
    and frogs and other things that were in this data set the way that again actually
    works is it is a。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Genrative， so generative means that it generates something generative models
    typically work with some sort of random input and they're generating something
    on the output。 Advdversarial means that there's adversaries。 So that means you
    need at least two things that are working adversarial to each other。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's two neural networks that are working together yet against each other。There's
    the discriminator and the generator。The discriminator learns to recognize fake
    data。 so it learns to recognize fake faces。 The generator， on the other hand。
    learns to generate data that will fool the discriminator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these two in lock step have sort of an arms race or a game as they try to
    get better and better。 The discriminator tries to get better and better at detecting
    attempts by the generator to fool the generator attempts to get better and better
    at fooling the discriminator。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， at the end of all of this training。 you will usually throw away either
    the discriminator or the generator。 Usually the discriminator。 So you'll get a
    generator that's very good at generating faces or some other sort of fake data
    that you want the neural network to create。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then the discriminator is going to not really have that much， that much
    of an actual use for you。 We'll see later when we deal with semi supervised training。
    which is a way that you're able to train a neural network on a data set that might
    be very large。 yet you only have labels or you only have wises or expected outcome
    on just a small number of those。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: When you have such a data set， you can use semi supervised training so that
    it learns both from the labeled and unlabeled data。 In that case， the discriminator
    becomes the one that you keep and you throw away the generator。 We'll deal with
    that later in this module when we get to。Part4 that actually covers semisupervised
    learning and also how to use this on nonimage data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You typically see this for generating faces， but that does not necessarily have
    to be the case Now in this module。 we're going to go through several parts This
    first part just gave you a overview of the technology talking about how this actually
    how these are actually trained and how we make use ofganNs for images and other
    things and how they actually work we'll also see how we can actually build one
    of these from scratch from Kis essentially。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so we will learn how to build the discriminator， how to build the generator
    and feed in these random values and create faces。You'll need a GPU for this because
    this is fairly training intense。 You're able to train at least some somewhat blurry
    faces that we'll see using Google coabab。 Then as we progress through this module，
    you'll also see how to use NviDdia style GN and that is what was generating those
    faces on that website that I was looking at earlier in this video then we'll also
    see how to use GNs for nonim data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just generating random sorts of additional data for data that you may already
    have。 and then finally we're going to look at some of the new directions in GAN
    research because this area is absolutely on fire。 I mean GNs are one of the most
    interesting， I think technologies available for。😊。Deep learning right now， or
    at least it's getting，' getting a lot of papers and other interest about them。
