- en: Hi， this is Jeffhein。 welcome to applications of deep neural networks with Washington
    University in this video we're going to look at GANs。 which are pairs of neural
    networks that are called generative adversarial neural networks You have a neural
    network that is generating images and another neural network that is trying to
    determine if those images are fake or real。

  zh: 嗨，我是Jeffhein。欢迎来到华盛顿大学的深度神经网络应用课程。在这个视频中，我们将看一下GANs，即称为生成对抗神经网络的成对神经网络。你有一个生成图像的神经网络，另一个神经网络则试图判断这些图像是假的还是现实的。

    several types of data in this course for the latest on my AI course and projects

- en: GANs stand for generative adversarial neural network This is really two neural
    networks that work together to produce a highly realistic image or other type
    of data So this person that you're looking at here is completely fake they don't
    exist they were created by a GAN that studied on many。

  zh: GAN是生成对抗神经网络的缩写。这实际上是两个神经网络共同工作，以生成一个高度逼真的图像或其他类型的数据。所以你在这里看到的这个人是完全虚假的，他们并不存在，是由一个学习了许多数据的GAN生成的。

- en: If you want to just play with this technology go to this person doesnotexist
    com。 This is the website that I'm using to generate this Later in this course。
    I'll show you how to use exactly the same technology that these guys are using
    on this website and how you can generate your own completely using your own computer
    or using Google coleb you do need a GPU to actually run stylegan well unless you
    make some modifications to it let's talk a little bit about how you can tell one
    of these fakegan images if you look at this person first of all the most obvious
    thing is always look to the background。

  zh: 如果你想玩玩这个技术，可以访问这个网址 doesnotexist.com。这是我用来生成这个的网页。在本课程的后面，我会告诉你如何使用这些人所使用的完全相同的技术，以及如何完全使用自己的计算机或谷歌Colab来生成。你确实需要一个GPU来运行stylegan，除非你对它进行一些修改。让我们稍微谈一下如何识别这些fakegan图像，如果你看这个人，首先最明显的事情总是要看背景。
- en: It's a bit surreal looking if you look at the background to one of these images
    it looks at first glance realistic but if you closely examine it much like a dream
    it's not real going on in here maybe that's some sort of marble background she's
    standing in front of there's also kind of a line here with a harsh change from
    one side to the other so that is definitely something to look for too。

  zh: 看起来有点超现实，如果你看其中一张图像的背景，乍一看似乎是现实的，但如果你仔细检查，就像梦一样，这里并不真实，也许那是一种大理石背景，她站在前面，另外一边也有一种从一侧到另一侧的强烈变化，所以这也是值得注意的地方。
- en: And look at their clothing， look for like the shoulders， so where's her shoulders。
    wheres it's it's not necessarily。Liing up， this is also too usually the headshot
    that you'll see from one of thesegans right up to the neck because they don't
    want to get the clothing too involved because that's that's a lot more difficult
    for the for the G to be dealing with。

  zh: 看一下他们的衣服，关注肩部的位置，她的肩膀在哪里？并不是完全对齐，这通常也是你在这些gan中看到的头部肖像，从脖子到头部，因为他们不想让衣服过于复杂，因为那对于G来说要处理起来要困难得多。
- en: not that some of the newer algorithms aren't aren't doing that。 I've seen Gs
    that are doing entire body shots now。 but let's refresh and see a few other faces
    because this is really what the Gs are particularly well known for。 Now， this
    one， the background is pretty solid color and a little photoshopping and you could
    rip out the G background。
  id: totrans-8
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 并不是说一些较新的算法没有做到这一点。我见过一些G现在可以做全身照。但让我们刷新一下，看看其他几张面孔，因为这确实是G特别著名的地方。现在，这张背景是比较单一的颜色，经过一些Photoshop处理，你可以去掉G的背景。
- en: 😊，And sub in a different， a different background。 Now this speaks more to photoshopping
    skills。 but you can see these hair that that blend in with the background。 somebody
    is not doing too good of a job with Photoshop。 they'll clip that right off and
    the hair will look very additional strands of it going into the background。

  zh: 😊，并替换成不同的背景。这更涉及到图像处理技能。但你可以看到这些头发与背景融合在一起。如果某人的Photoshop技巧不太好，他们会把那部分剪掉，头发看起来像是有额外的丝线延伸到背景中。
- en: We'll go through another thing too， is ears are very often not as symmetric
    as you would expect。 and especially if they have earrings See if I can find somebody
    with an earring。Often the earring on each side will be completely different so
    let's take a look at what this technology actually is GNs were introduced by Ian
    Goodfellow in 2014 and this is this is a technology that has really taken deep
    learning by by storm the first paper and 2014 did some fairly basic faces both
    with convolution neural networks and without this has been taken a lot further
    than just the images of digits that were generated and。

  zh: 我们还会讨论另一件事，耳朵通常不像你预期的那样对称，尤其是如果它们有耳环。看看我能否找到一个带耳环的人。通常两边的耳环会完全不同，所以让我们看看这项技术实际上是什么。生成对抗网络是由伊恩·古德费洛在2014年引入的，这项技术确实在深度学习中引起了轰动。2014年的第一篇论文生成了一些相对基本的面孔，包括卷积神经网络和不使用卷积神经网络的情况，这远远超出了仅生成数字图像的范畴。

- en: The fairly simple faces from the Toronto faces data set that Ian Goodfellow
    first worked with he also generated images and pictures from the CR data sets。
    you get kind of。Surreal ghostly looking images of some of the the dogs and cats
    and frogs and other things that were in this data set the way that again actually
    works is it is a。

  zh: 伊恩·古德费洛最初处理的多伦多面孔数据集中的相对简单的面孔，他还从CR数据集中生成了图像和照片。你会看到一些超现实的、幽灵般的狗、猫、青蛙等图像，这些图像的生成方式实际上是。
- en: Genrative， so generative means that it generates something generative models
    typically work with some sort of random input and they're generating something
    on the output。 Advdversarial means that there's adversaries。 So that means you
    need at least two things that are working adversarial to each other。
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 生成，意味着它生成某种东西，生成模型通常使用某种随机输入，并在输出中生成某种东西。对抗意味着有对抗者。所以这意味着你需要至少两个东西在相互对抗。
- en: So there's two neural networks that are working together yet against each other。There's
    the discriminator and the generator。The discriminator learns to recognize fake
    data。 so it learns to recognize fake faces。 The generator， on the other hand。
    learns to generate data that will fool the discriminator。
  id: totrans-14
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以有两个神经网络在一起工作，但又互相对抗。一个是判别器，另一个是生成器。判别器学习识别假数据，因此它学习识别假面孔。另一方面，生成器学习生成能够欺骗判别器的数据。
- en: And these two in lock step have sort of an arms race or a game as they try to
    get better and better。 The discriminator tries to get better and better at detecting
    attempts by the generator to fool the generator attempts to get better and better
    at fooling the discriminator。
  id: totrans-15
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 这两个模型在某种程度上有一种军备竞赛或博弈，因为它们试图变得越来越好。判别器试图变得越来越擅长检测生成器的欺骗尝试，而生成器则试图变得越来越擅长欺骗判别器。
- en: Now， at the end of all of this training。 you will usually throw away either
    the discriminator or the generator。 Usually the discriminator。 So you'll get a
    generator that's very good at generating faces or some other sort of fake data
    that you want the neural network to create。
  id: totrans-16
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在，在所有这些训练的最后，你通常会扔掉判别器或生成器。通常是判别器。所以你会得到一个非常擅长生成面孔或其他你希望神经网络创建的假数据的生成器。
- en: And then the discriminator is going to not really have that much， that much
    of an actual use for you。 We'll see later when we deal with semi supervised training。
    which is a way that you're able to train a neural network on a data set that might
    be very large。 yet you only have labels or you only have wises or expected outcome
    on just a small number of those。
  id: totrans-17
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 然后判别器对你来说实际上并没有太大的用处。稍后我们会看到，当我们处理半监督训练时，这是一种能够在可能非常大的数据集上训练神经网络的方法，而你只在其中少量数据上有标签或预期结果。
- en: When you have such a data set， you can use semi supervised training so that
    it learns both from the labeled and unlabeled data。 In that case， the discriminator
    becomes the one that you keep and you throw away the generator。 We'll deal with
    that later in this module when we get to。Part4 that actually covers semisupervised
    learning and also how to use this on nonimage data。
  id: totrans-18
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 当你有这样一个数据集时，你可以使用半监督训练，这样它就可以从标记数据和未标记数据中学习。在这种情况下，鉴别器是你保留的部分，而生成器则被丢弃。我们将在这个模块的后面部分4中处理这个问题，实际上会涵盖半监督学习，以及如何在非图像数据上使用它。
- en: You typically see this for generating faces， but that does not necessarily have
    to be the case Now in this module。 we're going to go through several parts This
    first part just gave you a overview of the technology talking about how this actually
    how these are actually trained and how we make use ofganNs for images and other
    things and how they actually work we'll also see how we can actually build one
    of these from scratch from Kis essentially。

  zh: 你通常会看到这一点用于生成面孔，但这并不一定是唯一的情况。在这个模块中，我们将逐步介绍几个部分。这第一部分只是给你提供了技术的概述，讨论这些是如何训练的，以及我们如何利用GANs进行图像等的处理，以及它们是如何工作的。我们还将看到如何从头开始构建这些模型。
- en: so we will learn how to build the discriminator， how to build the generator
    and feed in these random values and create faces。You'll need a GPU for this because
    this is fairly training intense。 You're able to train at least some somewhat blurry
    faces that we'll see using Google coabab。 Then as we progress through this module，
    you'll also see how to use NviDdia style GN and that is what was generating those
    faces on that website that I was looking at earlier in this video then we'll also
    see how to use GNs for nonim data。

  zh: 因此，我们将学习如何构建鉴别器，如何构建生成器，并输入这些随机值来创建面孔。你需要一个GPU，因为这个训练相对密集。你可以使用Google Colab来训练一些模糊的面孔。然后随着我们在这个模块中的进展，你还将看到如何使用NVIDIA风格的GAN，这就是我在本视频早些时候查看的那个网站上生成面孔的技术，接下来我们还将看到如何将GAN用于非图像数据。
- en: just generating random sorts of additional data for data that you may already
    have。 and then finally we're going to look at some of the new directions in GAN
    research because this area is absolutely on fire。 I mean GNs are one of the most
    interesting， I think technologies available for。😊。Deep learning right now， or
    at least it's getting，' getting a lot of papers and other interest about them。

  zh: 只是生成一些随机的额外数据，以补充你可能已经拥有的数据。最后，我们将看看GAN研究中的一些新方向，因为这个领域确实非常火热。我认为GANs是当前深度学习中最有趣的技术之一，或者至少它们正在获得大量论文和其他关注。😊
