    files and countless other different file types that are provided through using
    pandas。 which is what I'm using right here so I can come in and go computer sales
    which is a CSV file I've used in the past and you can see examples of what that
    looks like here and there we go but I'm not going to be doing that for this tutorial
    just to make it super easy for everybody I'm mainly going to be using seaborns
    built in data sets and you can see the type of things that are built into it just
    by going git data set names and there you can see in this don' just don't pay
    attention to this it's an error that comes up sometimes whenever we call for these
    data sets if we don't go and use them properly and it doesn't know what type of
    parcel we're using just don't worry about it so there's all kinds of different
    builtin data sets and I'm going be using at least three or。

    do I load one of those data sets Well， there's a car crash data set。 which I'm
    going to use here first and you just go load data set and then you type in the
    name for it which is car crashes right and you can see an example of what that
    looks like right here So you can see these are the total number of car crashes。
