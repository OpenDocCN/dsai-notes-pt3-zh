- en: In this video， I'm going to show you how to create an Excel macro from scratch。
    It's a simple one。 but it's a macro that will put you into full screen mode whenever
    you want it to。 And this video is one in a series on creating Excel macros。 Please
    check out the other macro videos as well。 So step1 is to go here to the quick
    access toolbar and click on this button here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'm going go here to more commands。 and at this point。 I'm actually going
    to switch to customize the ribbon and there's other ways to get here to customize
    the ribbon but it's important that you have this option selected developer。 If
    developer doesn't have a checkmark next to it， you need to do this step。 you need
    to put that checkmark in And what I'm doing here is I'm customizing the ribbon
    I'm adding an extra tab to the ribbon you can see there are other optional tabs
    that I could add but for the purposes of this video developers the one that you
    must have。

- en: So I'll click Now that I have the developer tab I can click on it here。 and
    look on the developer。I have a code group and there's some really exciting things
    you can do here in the code group。 You can record a macro， which is really fun
    and pretty easy to do。 I have a video specifically on that that I hope you'll
    watch or you can create and manage macros from scratch and that's what we're gonna
    do here I'm going click on visual basic to create a VBA macro and VB is visual
    basic for applications This is programming but don't let that intimidate you We're
    going to use a simple program It's basically like a recipe or a magic spell however
    you want to think about it and I'm going to include the code for this in the description
    below the video if you want to copy pastte it in you can do that So you'll notice
    here in this project window in the upper left It says VB project Spanish Animals
    quiz that's the spreadsheet that I'm using and it's got sheet1 listed and it's
    also got this workbook listed So where do I want this code to be stored in the
    workbook itself any sheet in the workbook。

- en: In one specific sheet I think I'll just put it in the entire workbook So any
    additional sheets that I add it should work for。 So I'm going to double click
    where it says this workbook and it brings up a space for me to type in the code
    that I'm going to use for this Vba macro I'm going to start by typing in the word
    sub and here I'm basically naming a subroutine I'll call this go full screen and
    then I'll put left and right parenthesis I'll tap enter on the keyboard and then
    I'll type in application dot display and you'll notice as soon as I start typing
    display I get a pop up with options that I can choose from I'm going to browse
    down display full screen that's what I want to do so I'll double click on that
    and then I'll put equals space and then underscore and then I'll tap enter and
    then I'll type not space application dot display full screen I'll tap enter and
    you'll see that Microsoft Vba in Excel has automatically put in end sub。

- en: So end subroutine at this point， I can X out of it and I'm back in Excel and
    I can now go to my macros button and there's my macro and we can test it out。
    So with this macro selected， I'm gonna click run and look it takes me into full
    screen mode which really might be a helpful thing to do in this case because this
    is a worksheet or a quiz that my students are going take to help them practice
    the Spanish animal words。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's kind of helpful to go into full screen for this。 I think I'm going tap
    escape on the keyboard to get out of full screen。 because I want you to see that
    there's a much better way to access that macro。 much better than going here to
    the macros button。 What we can do is set up our own button that when clicked will
    activate the macro So I could go here to insert and I could insert a button that
    way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: that's a great way to go。 but as you can see those buttons don't always look
    amazing。 they're kind of plane。 So in this video I want to show you an alternative
    way to put buttons into your spreadsheets I'm。To insert illustrations shapes and
    I'm going to draw out a button now you could use any of these shapes。 it could
    be a star button， a triangle button， whatever but I'm gonna go with this rectangle
    button with rounded corners so I click on it and I'm going to click and drag on
    the screen to draw out my button now that it's drawn I can go here to the shape
    format tab that appeared and I can choose the color scheme that I want to use
    whatever I think looks good and then I can double click on the shape and I'll
    type in full screen tap enter my text is pretty big so I'm gonna to have to stretch
    out my button a little bit and or shrink the text I think that looks pretty good
    if I want to I can even insert let's say an icon I can go here to insert illustrations
    icons and I'll do a search for screen let's say this represents full screen I'll
    click insert so I can add this icon to the button I'll shrink it down to a good
    size and put it right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There on my button now to make this an actual button that will execute the macro
    there's a couple of more steps we have to do One would be I need to group the
    icon and the button together so I clicked on the button now I'm going to hold
    the control key and click also on the icon with both selected I can right click
    and choose group group now that's all considered one thing and at this point I
    can right click on the button again and this time choose assign sign macro which
    macro how about this workbook go full screen I click Now if I click away from
    the button the full screen button is ready to be used so let's say the students
    are ready to take this practice quiz I of course need to clear out the correct
    answers but at this point I can click full screen and the spreadsheet goes full
    screen and the students can begin working with this interactive worksheet or quiz
    If I click full screen again notice that it toggles out of full screen so that's
    a nice feature as well。

- en: If you recall I created this in this workbook not just sheet1 so let's test
    that out If I go down here to the lower left and click the plus sign to add a
    second sheet。 I don't see my button but if I go to macros notice that the macro
    still does exist all I would need to do is go back to sheet1 right click on my
    button to copy it and then go to sheet2 right click to paste let's see if it works
    I click and it goes full screen I click again and it takes me out of full screen
    so I hope you can see some potential here for using this simple Excel macro to
    create a full screen button。
