- en: In this tutorialÔºå I'm going to show you one way to add check boxes into your
    Excel spreadsheets and we'll look at how that can be useful to you In a previous
    video„ÄÇ I showed you how to use a form control here on the developer tab in the
    controls group„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can insert form controls„ÄÇ And I showed you an example of one of those„ÄÇ There
    was a lot of interest in that video„ÄÇ And so I promised to make another form control
    video and here it is„ÄÇ So you can see in this spreadsheetÔºå I have an employee list
    with some basic information about the employees in a hypothetical company„ÄÇ And
    I would like to create a couple of columns with check boxes„ÄÇ SoÔºå for example„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: have they updated their contact information for the year 2020„ÄÇ and have they
    completed the driver's safety training„ÄÇ And there really are two or three different
    ways to add check boxes and to think about them„ÄÇ I'd like to show you the easiest
    example first„ÄÇ So here in cell E2Ôºå I would like to create„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Checkbox NowÔºå the absolute first step that you need to do is to make sure that
    you have the developer tab„ÄÇ It's not there by default„ÄÇ So for many of youÔºå you
    won't see that the way you get the developer tab„ÄÇ there's a couple of ways you
    could click on here„ÄÇ but probably the easiest way is to right click on the ribbon„ÄÇ
    So I'll just right click here„ÄÇ customize the ribbon„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it brings up some options that I can use to change the way the ribbon looks
    and what options appear there„ÄÇ and I'm just gonna go here to the right side where
    it says main tabs„ÄÇ and you'll notice that I have developer checked„ÄÇ if you don't„ÄÇ
    you need to check that if you want to add checkbox like I'm about to show So I'll
    click okay I have the developer tab„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I would like to add a checkbox right here„ÄÇ all I need to do is make sure
    I'm on the developer tab in the controls group„ÄÇ and I click on insertÔºå here are
    all the form controls„ÄÇ Now there's two sets of form controls„ÄÇ There's active x
    controls„ÄÇ those are a little bit harder but more powerful„ÄÇ But in this case„ÄÇ I
    don't„ÄÇNeed anything that powerful„ÄÇ I'll just go with regular form controls„ÄÇ These
    are easier„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and they'll do the job in this case„ÄÇ So here it is checkbox form control„ÄÇ I'll
    just click and then I need to click on the screen where I want that checkbox to
    appear„ÄÇ So I'll click right there„ÄÇ NowÔºå it didn't quite go in where I want it
    to be„ÄÇ And if I click away„ÄÇ you can see that„ÄÇ And if I click back on itÔºå look
    what happened it just check the box„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to move it up a little bit„ÄÇ and line it up correctly with Gina Puen„ÄÇ
    So the way to do this„ÄÇ you can't left click and drag you have to right click and
    drag„ÄÇ So not your typical process for moving something„ÄÇ but just because of the
    nature of form controls„ÄÇ you do have to use right click drag in order to move
    these form controls in many cases„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll click move here„ÄÇ and that's a lot better„ÄÇ Now you'll notice the checkbox
    comes in with some text„ÄÇ Sometimes you want that text„ÄÇ sometimes you don't in
    this case„ÄÇI do want to use the text„ÄÇ but I want to change what the text says„ÄÇ
    So I'm gonna right click on it„ÄÇ click edit text and I get a cursor now that I
    can use to erase„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I just tapped the right arrow key and I'm going use the delete key on the
    keyboard to delete what's there and I'll just type in updated„ÄÇ So if this checkbox
    is checkedÔºå I know that this person has updated their contact information recently
    I'll uncheck that for now So now I need to do all of that all over again right
    for Marcelinina Rerepo for Regia Lofts and for all of these other wonderful people„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: WellÔºå the good news is that you can click on in this case E2 and you can use
    the autofill handle„ÄÇ this little square in the lower right corner of the cell
    that's selected you can click and drag and pull that down and look what it does
    it just copies the contents of that cell all the way down„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and in this case the cell had„ÄÇIn itÔºå a form control„ÄÇ So that's a big relief
    that you can just click and drag to add these check boxes all the way down the
    spreadsheet„ÄÇ So that really is pretty easyÔºå pretty doableÔºå rightÔºå to add simple
    check boxes„ÄÇ Well„ÄÇ I want to show you a little bit harder example„ÄÇ But I think
    it'll be rewarding for you to watch this„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It is possible to use these check boxes for more than just a visual cu that
    something has been completed or that some characteristic can be applied to this
    person or thing„ÄÇ So I'm gonna click here on F to in this case„ÄÇ againÔºå on the developer
    tab in the controls group„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will click insert checkbox and do the same stepsÔºå right„ÄÇ click and drag to
    put it in the proper place„ÄÇ In this case„ÄÇ I'm going right click on it and just
    delete the text just so that you can see that you do have both options„ÄÇ So the
    checkbox nowÔºå just simply means that yesÔºå they did complete the driver' safety
    training„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But nextÔºå I'm going to right click on the„ÄÇüòäÔºåCheckbox and I'm gonna go down to
    format control„ÄÇ And this brings up some options for that checkbox„ÄÇ What's the
    default value of that checkbox unchecked or checked or mixed mixed is basically
    grayed out„ÄÇ I'm going go with unchecked„ÄÇ That's the default„ÄÇ nextÔºå there's an
    option for a cell link„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I can link this checkbox to a cell„ÄÇ And the results of this checkbox can
    go to that other cell„ÄÇ So I'm gonna click here on this arrow„ÄÇ It's a button„ÄÇ So
    I click there„ÄÇ And now it hides the rest of the options„ÄÇ And now I can just click
    on the cell that I want to be linked to this checkbox„ÄÇ So I'm gonna click here
    on G2 and then I can go back and click that arrow again„ÄÇ That's great„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I want toÔºå I can add some 3D shading to the checkbox„ÄÇ let's see what that
    looks like„ÄÇ So now I click okay And you can see my checkbox now does have some
    3D shading„ÄÇ That's kind of cool„ÄÇ NowÔºå look what happens when I check the box„ÄÇBecause
    I linked cell G2 to the check box„ÄÇ It's telling me whether it's true or not that
    the box is checked„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And it's also saying it's true that they have had the driver safety training„ÄÇ
    right„ÄÇ that's all linked up„ÄÇ So this is great„ÄÇ I like this a lot„ÄÇ So now let's
    try the same thing that we did before„ÄÇ Let's try the autofill handle to copy this
    down the page„ÄÇ Now it's a little tricky here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes if you clickÔºå you might be clicking on the checkbox„ÄÇ So just be careful„ÄÇ
    you might need to right click in order to select the cell„ÄÇ But just get that same
    autofill handle and you can copy it down„ÄÇ NowÔºå let's see if it works„ÄÇ Notice when
    I check one checkboxÔºå they all get checked„ÄÇ And they're all working off of G2„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so that's a problem„ÄÇ I need to right click on my second checkbox and go
    to form control„ÄÇ and I need to update this to be G3„ÄÇ and then I'll go backÔºå click
    O„ÄÇAnd I'll click away„ÄÇ Let's try it now„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so now it's working independently
    from the other ones„ÄÇ And so this is one of the downsides to the way the checkbox
    form control works in Excel„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I am gonna have to update each of these„ÄÇ NowÔºå learning the patternÔºå I can just
    go in and type„ÄÇ I can just type4 for G4„ÄÇ And it works„ÄÇ So I'll be honest that
    this is a little bit of a hassle„ÄÇ especially if you have a giant spreadsheet„ÄÇ
    That's why I think in this case„ÄÇ the example of a list of employees for a small
    business or a midsized business„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I think that's a good example of when I would do this more difficult„ÄÇ more complicated
    kind of checkbox„ÄÇ because this way it's not an outrageous amount of work„ÄÇ If I
    had a spreadsheet with1 thousand records„ÄÇ I don't think this would be a wise way
    to create checkboxes„ÄÇ And there are other ways that you can get to something similar
    to this„ÄÇ In my opinion„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: these are the best methods for adding checkbox„ÄÇBut this is the downside what
    I just showed that you have to update the cell reference„ÄÇ If you want to use the
    data the way I'm about to show„ÄÇ So give me a minute to fix the rest of these form
    control cell links„ÄÇ and then I'll resume the video„ÄÇ so I've finished updating
    these and now you can see that I can very easily mark whether or not each employee
    has completed their driver safety training„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now the nice thing about having this report false or true is that then you could
    set up a formula basically an if statement you could click here so this cell is
    equal to if and then you could basically say if this cell says true„ÄÇ then do something
    you could also use conditional formatting as well„ÄÇ So for example„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could have the employees who have not completed the driver safety training
    highlight in red„ÄÇ So there's a visual cu saying that they need to get this completed„ÄÇ
    And then of course„ÄÇ if I wanted to I could even hide this column just by„ÄÇ![](img/2441a26a79ae27fdf3f186e170b77f3b_2.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Right clicking on the column letter„ÄÇ I could go down to hide„ÄÇ And that true
    faultÔºå true fault„ÄÇ It still exists is still in the spreadsheetÔºå but it's hidden
    from the view of the people that look at the spreadsheet„ÄÇ So now it's just about
    the text boxesÔºå at least visually„ÄÇ If you're interested in seeing how I could
    make the records light up in red or green or any other color by using the conditional
    formatting and also the ways I could use if functions to do some things with this
    spreadsheet„ÄÇ
