- en: In this tutorial， we're going to take a look at the exciting new ifs function
    in Excel。 This is a new feature， a new function that was brand new in Excel 2019。
    And that also includes Office 365。 So before we dive in to this new ifs function。
    let's take a look at the regular if function that's been in Excel for many， many
    years。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: here we have a spreadsheet with a list of student numbers， student names and
    their test scores。 Let's say this is a college class。 They've taken a test， and
    these are their scores。 Well。 I could use the if function to do some basic automatic
    grading。 So let's look at how to do that with the traditional if function that
    we've had for quite some time。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Step 1 would be to click on a cell tap equals if left parenthesis。 And we get
    a pop up with some help。 It says if logical test value if true comma value if
    faults。 So I need a logical test。Let's say if D2 is greater than 59 then and I'll
    put a comma to represent then if you look at the help text that we're getting
    here。 it says now value if true so here I'm supposed to put what is displayed
    if D2 is indeed greater than 59 Well I want it to print on the screen the word
    pass the quotes signify print on the screen now I put a comma and here this is
    like saying if not。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so let's back up if D2 is greater than 59， then print pass If not。 then print
    fail and then I'll put in the parenthesis and tap enter on the keyboard and notice
    what it does Excel tests to see if D2 is greater than 59 if it is pass and that's
    what happened pass so now I can just use the autofill handle by clicking on E2
    where my formula is and going to the autofill handle I can click and hold and
    drag down for the entire list of students。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And we can calculate whether they passed or failed。 Now， there's an even faster
    way to do that。 I could just double click on the autofill handle， and that will
    automatically deploy it all the way down the column。 So this is great， right，
    Well， yes， it is。 But what if I want to do more than pass fail。 What if I want
    to say if it's greater than 92， then it's an a。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could go in and say equals if left parentheesis。 D2 is greater than 92 then
    print a。 And I don't have to put and if not， or if false， I don't have to， I could
    just stop it there。 or I could continue and say if it's not greater than 92。 then
    what would I say pass or fail or B or C， I need more here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to be able to create a formula that calculates more than just whether
    one statement is true。 You can see the results I'm getting here。 They're all either
    falses or a。 That's all that it's capable of doing。 So traditionally。The solution
    to this problem was to create a formula with what's called a nested if。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but nested ifs can be pretty confusing and pretty hard at first。 And so in Excel
    2019。 and also if you have Office 365。 Now we have a new solution。 We have a new
    function called ifs。 And it really does solve this issue that I just explained
    to you。 I'll just click and drag down and erase the results that were generated
    with the formula that I created。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So back up to the top here， let's do a similar thing but use ifs。 So I clicked
    on cell E2 equals ifs left parenthesis。 and you can see again， I get some help
    text。 It wants a logical test and then comma value if true， comma， etc ce。 So
    let's take a look at how this could work。 First， I'll start by clicking on D2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: just like I did before。 So ifs D2 is greater than 92， then print a。And then
    I'll put another comma。 What if it's not greater than 92。 If it's not， then maybe
    this next logical test is true。 Maybe D2 is greater than 89。 and then comm， if
    that's the case， then I want to print a minus。 Let me scoot over a little bit
    so you can see this a little better， What if that's not true。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then maybe D2 is greater than 84， and if it is， then print B plus I put the
    close Well。 what if that's not true。 What if none of these are true， then， let's
    see if D2 is greater than 79。 if it is， then print B。 So hopefully you're seeing
    the pattern here， I'm creating a series of tests。 If the first test is true， then
    the logic stops there， Excel will just put an a in cell E2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But if that test comes up falses， then it will look for the next test and see
    if the results of this test are true。 if they are a minus。 And so it just keeps。Looking
    for something that is true。 give me a minute to finish this pattern， and then
    I'll resume the video。 Okay。 so I've finished my formula。 Let me just quickly
    show it to you。 As you can see。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've established different score ranges for each of the letter grades。 And notice
    that after D minus， I say if D2 is less than 58。 Then it's an F。 Okay。 so now
    that I've got my formula with many， many ifs in it。 That's why the function is
    called ifs。 All I have to do is tap enter on the keyboard。 and it calculates the
    grade for this first person in my list for Gina。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I can just double click on the autofill handle。 and it should calculate
    the grades all the way down for all of the students。 You can see the range of
    scores and letter grades。 This example。 I think demonstrates why ifs is so important。
    and it's such a great addition to Excel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's so much easier than a nested if。 Now， watch what happens， What if let's
    say。New student comes in to the class。 Good old John White， and we extend the
    formula down。 noticeice that it gives John an F。 Well， John hasn't really taken
    the test。 So let's say I have not applicable in here or something similar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The formula is getting messed up a little bit。 So let's look at something that
    we can do to perhaps fix this。 It doesn't always need to happen。 but sometimes
    when you use ifs to create a formula。 you might need to put in one final logical
    test at the end of your formula。 What if none of these logical tests result in
    a true。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: what you can do is you can force there to be a true to do that， just put another
    comma in。 type the word true， put a comma and then in quotes what you want to
    have appear。 if none of these other logical tests are true。 So I'm forcing this
    to be true as a last resort。 And what I'll put is test not taken。 I'll put that
    in quotes， tap enter on the keyboard and let's。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Auttofi that down。 But notice it still didn't quite work。 The reason why。 for
    some reason the formula is interpreting this as being greater than 92。 In Excel。
    letters can sometimes be interpreted to have a numerical value。 And so that may
    be why this is showing up as an A。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So even though it didn't really help us in this case。 It is important to know
    about this true logical test at the end of the formula。 Let's look at a second
    example of when the ifs function might be helpful here on my second spreadsheet。
    It's an employee list。 So I've got my employees here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I've got the department that they're part of here。 And I would like Excel to
    automatically calculate and display who their supervisor is。 Yes。 I could do this
    manually。 but in the future， new employees will be added。 I'll put in their department
    and the supervisor will be automatically calculated and printed on the screen。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So how to do that。 Well， just like before， I'll start by clicking， typing equals。Left
    parenthesis B2 is equal to custodial。 Now， because I'm dealing with a word here。
    I'm dealing with text， not a number。 I have to put it in quotes， and it's easy
    to forget that。 but you've got to do it So if B2 is equal to custodial in quote
    then print Tiffany as the supervisor。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if that logical test is not true， then test to see if B is equal to marketing。
    If it is then print at。 If that logical test fails。 then test to see if B2 is
    equal to customer service。 Give me a minute to complete this formula and then
    I'll resume the video。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I've finished my formula at least for now， and you can see what it looks
    like。 this is a pretty complicated if's formula， and it's just going work from
    left to right。 it's going check to see if this is true if it is it'll print Tiffany。
    if it's not true it'll move on to the next one。 It's looking for something that's
    true。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you can see I didn't put in every single。So let's see what happens when
    I tap enter on the keyboard to make that formula effective。 It found that Alan's
    supervisor in the custodial department is Tiffany。 Well。 let's autofill this down，
    double clicking on the autofill handle。 Let's see how it works。 you can see it
    looks like it's working pretty well。 but look。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I didn't put in anything in the formula for human resources。 And so Excel sees
    that as an error。 and it puts in an N error message not applicable。 And there's
    other examples of that here， too。 And that looks kind of ugly。 It doesn't look
    great。 So this is a good example of when it can be important to force a true at
    the end of your formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's do that。 And in order to see this better， I'm gonna to have to zoom
    out a little bit。 but I'll just double click on the formula。 And so you can see
    here at the end。 I'll just put in a comma， and then force a true statement。 So
    true comma。 and then I'll type in not applicable。 Now you'll notice true is not
    in quotes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because it's not really。Text， it's a function。 Basically。 All right。 I'm gonna
    tap enter on the keyboard。 Let's autofill that down and you can see what happens。
    Now there are no error messages。 It just says not applicable。 Now， of course，
    later。 I might decide to change that and say something like reports to CEO。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So there's no supervisor just reports directly to the top。 Lucy people。 So I
    can autofill that down。 and it changes it all the way down。 Let's say a person
    switches departments。 Todd switches to legal their supervisor changes。 So I hope
    you can see the great potential in the ifs function and using it in your formulas。
    You can do something like  a hundred and 50 some odd logical tests in one formula
    using the if's function。
