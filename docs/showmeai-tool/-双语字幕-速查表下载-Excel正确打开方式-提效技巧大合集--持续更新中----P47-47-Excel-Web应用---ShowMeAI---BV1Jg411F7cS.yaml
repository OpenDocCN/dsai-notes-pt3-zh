    free„ÄÇ Not only can you view other people's Excel spreadsheetsÔºå you can create
    your own„ÄÇ you can save them in various formatsÔºå you can share them easily with
    other people„ÄÇ This really is an underappreciated way to use Microsoft Excel„ÄÇ

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what it is is it's called Excel for web„ÄÇ So this is an online version of
    Microsoft Excel to access it„ÄÇ just go to Office do co„ÄÇ It'll look something like
    this„ÄÇ and you can see it says sign up for the free version of officeÔºå you can
    also just click sign in„ÄÇ Now if you click this button hereÔºå get office„ÄÇ Microsoft
    will encourage you to buy Microsoft 365 and it's got some options for you„ÄÇ

    the free version of office„ÄÇ I'll click sign in„ÄÇ It takes me to this screen where
    I can put in any of my Microsoft email addresses„ÄÇ If you have an outlook email

    Give me a minute to sign in my Microsoft account and then I'll resume the video„ÄÇ
    Okay so here I am in my Microsoft Office online interface and you can see here
    at the left I should have quick access to each of the most common Microsoft Office
    products there's word Excel PowerPoint there's outlooklook Onenote to do and more
    so this is great I can quickly switch between those products if I want to I can
    even add a shortcut on my desktop that will quickly take me here I'm not gonna
    do that in this case but it's a good option So here at the left you'll also see
    a create button looks like a plus sign if I click that I can quickly create any
    of these types of documents online in my new office online account that's completely
    free I'll just go here and choose spreadsheet and if any of you have used the
    G suite Google Docs Google sheetets Google slides this is a similar idea„ÄÇ

- en: But it's from MicrosoftÔºå these are real Microsoft spreadsheets that we'll be
    creating and same with PowerPoint and Word so what we have here„ÄÇ like I sayÔºå is
    Microsoft ExcelÔºå but it's in the cloud it's online we still have a similar layout
    that you get in Excel for Windows or for Mac I have tabs so each of these tabs
    can be clicked on when I click on a tab it changes the ribbon Now you'll notice
    the ribbon isn't quite the same as with the installed downloaded version that
    you have to pay for of Microsoft Excel the ribbon has the most essential the most
    commonly used options and features but it doesn't have everything If I look at
    the insert tab and ribbon I can see that I can insert graphs and charts but I
    don't see smart artt listed there so we get the most important most common options
    and settings but not everything just like with the desktop versions of Microsoft
    Excel I can click once to get on a I can click„ÄÇ

    type and then tap enter or tab to make that data go into the cell„ÄÇ En generally
    moves you down the spreadsheet tab moves you to the right if you hold shift and
    tap tab it moves you to the left Shi and tap enter and it moves you up„ÄÇ So with
    tab and shift tabÔºå you can move right and left and with enter and shift enter„ÄÇ

  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    the specific cell that you want to go to So I can enter information that way right
    into Excel„ÄÇ Give me a minute to enter some dataÔºå and then I'll resume the video„ÄÇ
    I can format my spreadsheet and the data just by clicking and dragging„ÄÇ I can
    select what I want to effect„ÄÇ that's my motto when using Excel select to effect„ÄÇ

    also center the data„ÄÇ I could highlight the dataÔºå change the text color„ÄÇ We really
    do„ÄÇHave the most important features and most commonly used features in Microsoft
    Excel„ÄÇ but they're online for free in Excel for web„ÄÇ I'm going to add just a little
    bit more data here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this new data I wish it were formatted like the rest of the data here„ÄÇ All
    I have to do is select an example of what I want it to be formatted like and then
    go to the home tab click here on the format painter and then click on the new
    information that I would like to format the same way and it formats it I'm really
    glad that the format painter is part of this Excel for the web I want you to also
    see that formulas work in Excel for web so I'll click here on equals and I'll
    type in a formula„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: some left parenthesis and then I can either select what I want to be added up
    or I can describe it so I can type in D2 through and we indicate through with
    a colon D4 and then put my right parenthesis you don't really have to put it there
    but it's probably a good idea to get in the habit and then I can tap enter and
    it adds up the total years of experience„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The way to do the same thing would be to type equals sum left parentheesis and
    then click and drag to show Excel the data that I want added up and then just
    tap enter and because sum is so common there actually is an autos option so I
    can click on the cell underneath in this case the years of experience and I can
    go here on the home tab here there is an autos button that I can click tap enter
    and it does the same thing So with this free version of Excel for web I can really
    use Excel This is definitely Excel but it's completely free and easy to share
    and access wherever I want to access it speaking of sharing the way you would
    share this with other people is by clicking here on the share button and we have
    some settings to think about here right now anyone with the link will be able
    to edit this data if I want to change that I have to click I can take off editing
    people will be able to see it but they won't be able to change it I could put
    an expiration date which is kind of exciting but that's a premium feature so you
    would have to pay for micro„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: of365 to have that option and same with password protecting So I need to decide„ÄÇ
    do I want people to be able to edit or only to see in my caseÔºå I'm gonna allow
    editing„ÄÇ I'll click apply and then I can send it to a group of people each member
    of that team would be able to either edit it or view it or I could just copy a
    link So now anyone with this link will be able to edit the spreadsheet so I copy
    that and then I could paste it into an email send it to people or share it in
    any other way that I want to share that link Now what if at some point I want
    to turn this into a document that's actually on my computer because so far this
    spreadsheet exists only in the cloud on the internet all I would have to do is
    click on file and take a look down here at some of the options that I have I can
    save this as and one of the options is download a copy this would be a real Excel
    document Another option is to download it as an OD file an open document file
    I'll go with this download a copy and this is saved a copy of„ÄÇ

- en: Spreadsheet to my computer I probably should have named it first I can do that
    here where it says book I can call this employee list and click away and now when
    I download it„ÄÇ save as download a copy now it downloads with the proper name and
    I can click and open this up in actual Microsoft Excel installed on my computer
    Now there is another way to access Excel for the web what I can do is go down
    here to the lower left corner click here on the search magnifying glass and I
    can just type in office notice that there's an office app if I click on that it
    opens up an interface that looks quite similar to what I showed you on office
    co but this is on my actual computer you can see there's the document that I just
    created in Excel for the web and I can open it up from this office app but it
    also shows me every single Microsoft Office document that's on my computer so
    that's nice It combines what's online with what's on the computer and then if
    I want to get directly into Excel for web„ÄÇ
