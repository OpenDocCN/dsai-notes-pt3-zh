- en: Hi， this is Jeff Hean。 Wele to applications of Deep neural networks with Washington
    University。 In this video， we're going to talk about how to do feature engineering
    with pandas in Python。 This allows you to prepare the data set， especially when
    you have tabular data。 Now。 this is not dealing with feature engineering for images，
    audio or natural language processing。

- en: But how to get column type data in a format that the neural network might be
    more predictive。 There's many different ways that you can do feature engineering。
    and this is often cited as one of the top ways to get highly accurate models and
    competitions such as Cale for the latest on my AI course and projects。 click subscribe
    in the bell next to it to be notified of every new video。 Now。

- en: we're gonna to look at some more advanced feature engineering and other ways
    that you can engineer features using pandas。 You can do calculated fields。 We've
    seen a little bit of this before but say you wanted to have the weight and kilograms
    or just some other calculation based on one of these。

- en: You can run this for the autompG and now you have the weight in kilograms。 this
    would probably not be too useful of an engineered feature because it would be
    extremely highly correlated to the weight。In pounds like the data set originally
    had。 but nonetheless you could。 you could engineer something like that， Usually
    you'd want something where you're dividing weight by something else or in some
    way normalizing。

- en: A very common way for feature engineering and I do this a lot in my day job。
    but it's something called augmentation， so we're going to take additional data
    that we might get from an API externally。 and we're going to augment our data
    with that because that additional data will likely give us additional predictive
    power in our neural network。Now usually you have to pay for this additional data。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: sometimes you can find it for free Google API Keys has all sorts of such data
    and I am going to use this data to deal with addresses。 so I'm going to give you
    an example here of how I might augment a data set for addresses。Now to do this，
    you're going to need a Google key。And the last time I put one of these in here。
    I got several requests of can you give me your Google key， you're basically asking。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: can you give me a conduit into your credit card that I can charge and sadly
    the answer is no。But I am going to。Put my Google key in here。Burrrring it out，
    obviously。And run that。And now we have my Google key in there， I'm going to remove
    it。Just so that I don't accidentally save it。With it in there。By the way， that's
    a catastrophe。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you check something into GitHub with a API key for something like AWS。 Bitcoin
    miners and other unscrupulous people， not that all Bitcoin miners are unscrupulous。Well
    basically find your credentials and you'll have like a $20，000 bill within a day，
    so that's bad。Don't do that。 Don't ever check private keys into GitHub。 It's done
    all the time， though。

- en: So what we're going to do is deal with addresses you might have an address like
    one Brookings Drive。 St。 Louis Missouri Oh by the way， if you want to get your
    own Google key to do this。 go to Google API keys and get one for something called
    Gecode。So here what we're going to do is I'm going to put in the address of Washington
    University on Brookings Drive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I am going to ping Google， putting my key into there。Get my response back
    and then parse it out。 and I will actually be able to get the location。In latitude
    and longitude of Washington University。Latitude， this longitude that， so that's
    pretty cool。I now can get a latitude and longitude。 now you could use those as
    features。It's going to show you how east and west versus how north and south something
    is I've built data sets where I've used those two as features and they're quite
    useful。

- en: In the insurance industry where I work， we're always interested in unhealthy
    habits like smoking。 so we very often will build models that will tell us the
    probability of somebody smoking。Latitude and longitude， are they predictive of
    smoking well here's the CDC's chart of the United States and which states smoke
    a lot versus don't。 so yes， locations very predictive of if you smoke or not。You'll
    want other features in that model。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you can see location means a lot what we're going to do is use that latitude
    and longitude to calculate distances between cities。This might let you calculate
    how far somebody is from say a metropolitan center or something such as this this
    is a formula in triometry that calculates the great circle distance between any
    two points on a sphere I'm not going to go into why that works or how that works。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this basically then gives you a calculation of the distance between between
    two latitudes and longitudes。So I'll go ahead and run this。And it tells me the
    distance between say St Louis。 Missouri and Fort Lauderdale， Florida。Is 1684 kilometers，
    if youd prefer that in impmperial。 then you can convert to miles。But you might
    want to look at the distance between， say。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: a person's address and major metropolitan area， the distance between one company
    and a nearby competitor。 a distribution center， retail outlet。This code calculates
    how far Washington University is from a bunch of other universities。In the United
    States。This would work internationally as well。Google Gecode does that。And this
    is how far away we are to other universities， I just pick these guys at random。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is yet another way that you can make use of something that's very， I
    mean think about it。 how would you normalize and address to put it into the feature
    vector that would be very difficult。This gives you a way that you might be able
    to do that。

- en: Thank you for watching this video。 The first two modules of this course。 which
    you have now concluded watching， all cover some of the Python preliminaries。 and
    the next video will start to actually get into Tensorflowlow and Kes。 This content
    changes often。 so subscribe to the channel to stay up to date on this course and
    other topics and artificial intelligence。
