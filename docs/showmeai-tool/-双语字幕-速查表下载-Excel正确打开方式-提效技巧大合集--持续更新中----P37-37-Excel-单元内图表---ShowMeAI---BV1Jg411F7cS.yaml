- en: In this Excel video， I want to show you how to create ince charts in Microsoft
    Excel。 These are amazing， very useful and obviously take up much less space than
    your typical Excel chart。 There actually are a few different ways to create in
    cellll charts。 I'll focus on2 if you've watched all my videos， you probably already
    know about how to use conditional formatting to create some in cell charts charts
    that can be seen from within a cell instead of floating on top of many cells。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at how you can do that。 And for this example。 I'm using a spreadsheet
    that lists the total mileage driven by every employee in a particular company。
    And you can get a copy of this practice spreadsheet in the description below。
    So I hope you look at that download it and use it。

- en: So to use conditional formatting to create inc charts。 The first thing I need
    to do is select the column where I want those in cellll charts to appear In this
    case column I It selects the entire column and now I can go to the home tab。Home
    ribbon in the Sts group， I can click on conditional formatting。 and there's an
    option for data bars。 You can see there's gradient fill options。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And as I put my mouse on the options， you can see previews of what it'll look
    like in Microsoft Excel。 There's also solid fills。 I'm going go with gradient
    fill I think that looks good。 and I can just click to apply that。 And now I have
    basically a bar chart inside of the cells in Excel。 So this is one example of
    inc charts。 I'm going to undo that by holding control and tapping Z on the keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I just want to point out that in addition to the options I've already shown。
    you can also go down here to more rules and make some adjustments。 so I could
    pick a different color if I want to， and I could change the bar direction。 I could
    go from right to left instead of left to right。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's just lots of different options for creating your inll charts this way
    through conditional formatting。 So that's a wonderful option that we have。 and
    I love that。OBut in some ways。 this next method of adding insll charts is even
    better。 Instead of just showing a simple chart that shows the total mileage。

- en: I would really like to see a chart that shows the trend。 What's the trend for
    Kaina here。 Is she driving more less over time。 staying basically the same。 What
    are the trends for these employees。 So let's look at how to do that。 I'll click
    here in cell H3 in this case。 and I'll go to insert here on the insert ribbon。

- en: you should find a spark lines group。 Now， Sp lines are available in some of
    the newer versions of Microsoft Excel。 So if you're using an older version of
    it， you may not see that。 but if you do have it。 take a look you can go to line
    and a dialog box or a popup box appears。 And here I can select the data range
    that I would like this line chart to track。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could type the range here， but the easiest way to do this is just to click
    this arrow。 and then click and drag to select。lect the range that I want to track
    the trend for。 Now that it's selected， I can click this arrow again。 The range
    that I selected is here。 and then just click O， and I get a beautiful spark line
    incell chart。 It looks great。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I can easily and quickly see the Kaina's use of a personal vehicle is trending
    down a little bit。 Okay， now I need to gear up for doing those same steps again
    for epiphonia。 and for everyone else。 that's an employee of the company。 right，
    Well， actually no。 you don't have to do those steps over and over for each person。
    instead。

- en: simply click on the first spark line that's been created。 And I can now go to
    the lower right corner。 you can see。 hopefully the green square that's there。
    That's the autofill handle or sometimes called the fill handle。 I'll just put
    my mouse pointer on that little green square。 click and hold the click。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then pull down all the way down as far as I need to go and then release
    the mouse button。 and I get that same beautiful spark line。Look showing the trend
    for each of the employees Now that I've added the spark lines。 you'll notice that
    I have a new tab and a new ribbon that has appeared at the top of Excel。 As long
    as I have the spark lines selected。 It'll appear。 It's got all sorts of great
    options。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can edit the data In this case。 I don't want to do that。 I have the exact
    data that I want to track。 I could switch from a line chart to a column chart。
    it still kind of shows the trend， but it's a little harder to understand， in my
    opinion。 same with wind loss。 it doesn't really convey the information very well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll stick with a line chart。 Next， we have some really neat options。 I can
    have those spark lines show even more information。 I can show the high point and
    the low point。 So look closely。 and I'll zoom in a little bit so you can see that
    better。 So now the high point and low point of each spark line is marked by a
    dot。 and that will help draw attention to it。 I can also choose to show negative
    point markers of each change where I can identify the last。Point and the first
    point。 So each of those options can be very powerful to draw attention to key
    parts of the incell chart。 Next， we can adjust the style of the spark line or
    ince chart。 So I can make it black and white。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can change it to blue。 If I click here。 I get all of the different style options
    that are available。 Some of these are more colorful than others。 It just depends
    on what you want and how you want to convey the information。 There are even more
    sparkline color options here and marker options over to the right。 you can switch
    the access of the chart。 if it makes sense to do so。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can also clear the spark lines if you want。 I don't want to do that。 And
    there are some other options as well。 I'm going zoom out so you can get a good
    look at the two different kinds of inll charts that I've shown you how to make。
    I think these look great。 Thanks for watching。 I hope you found the tutorial to
    be helpful。
