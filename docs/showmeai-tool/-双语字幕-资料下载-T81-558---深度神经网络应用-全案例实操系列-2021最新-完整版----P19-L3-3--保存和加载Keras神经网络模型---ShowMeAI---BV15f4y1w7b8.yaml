- en: Hi this is Jeff Heaton， welcome to applications of Deep neural Networks with
    Washington University In this video we're going to see how to load and save Kara's
    neural networks from disk。Once you spent all this time training a neural network，
    you want to actually be able to save a copy。
  prefs: []

- en: This is also useful for when you save a copy of a trained neural network that
    you're going to deploy to a web application or web service。 like we'll see later
    in this semester。![](img/fcb55d43d6ed5e04848ece71f7dd4972_1.png)

- en: For the latest on my AI course and projects， click subscribe and the bell next
    to it to be notified of every new video Now when you save and load to Kira's neural
    network。 you have several different file types that you can choose from。And two
    of these are textuals。

- en: so you can actually open up the file and look at it in a text editor and see
    the components of the neural network。I usually don't do that， but you can if you
    wanted to so you could。Like in JSON。 there's plenty of tools that will read and
    write JSON。 so you could actually access the save state of the neural network
    directly。

- en: So Yaml is a format that only stores the structure of the neural network， it
    does not store weights。Similarly， JO does not store the weights either。That's
    why I don't use those first two that often。 unfortunately， those are the textual
    formats that are easiest to read。 HD F 5 not to be confusedfuse with HDFS， which
    is a spark and Hadoop format。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That is the usual format that I will store these to。The first two。 you can use
    if you don't need to store the actual weights。This demonstrates how you would
    do this。So here we're opening the auto MPG data set that we had before。 we're
    going to build almost exactly the same neural network that we built before。We're
    going to。

- en: Do the predictions and calculate the root mean square error。And print that out。We're
    going to save that neural network to network Json file。 which will go to the same
    directory as your， as your work book。 We'll save it as Json willll save it as
    Yaml and we'll save it as H 5。

- en: and we can go ahead and run that。And it's complete now notice the RMSE 7。17。Every
    time you run this。 you're going to get a slightly different RMSC。 that's actually
    a slightly bad one。 you can definitely do better than that， but it's good enough
    to test this feature。Now we're going to load it。And notice the values are exactly
    the same。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That shows that this was really saved to a disk file and brought back。 because
    if you re ran it and retrained it， those would be completely different values。
    and that that would not work very well。Now this technique is going to be used
    throughout this class。 in fact， in the next section that's coming up， early stopping
    we'll see that we can program the neural network to use only as many epoes it
    actually needs。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it will actually stop and save the neural network at the optimal point then
    you can reload the optimal weights later。We're also later in this class going
    to see how we can deploy a neural network to a web application or similar。And
    being able to save your train neural network is very useful。So that you can deploy
    it into into the cloud or into something else。

- en: Now that you've seen how to save and load Car's neural networks。 we're going
    to look in the next video about how to use early stopping to stop the neural network
    before it overfits saving and loading comes into play here because the neural
    network saved。
