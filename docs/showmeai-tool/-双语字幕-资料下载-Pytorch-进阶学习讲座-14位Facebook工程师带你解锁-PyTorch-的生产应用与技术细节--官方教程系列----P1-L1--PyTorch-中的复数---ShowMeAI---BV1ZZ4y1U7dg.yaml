- en: Hi， everyone。 Thanks for having me here today。 My name is Anjuli。 and I've spent
    the last year working on an exciting project in the Pytorch team。 That project
    is complex numbers， and that's all we're going to be talking about today。 So jumping
    right in。 let's talk a little about what complex numbers are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Some of you may already be familiar with complex numbers。 but I'll just go over
    them briefly to make sure we're on the same page。😊。![](img/30cfbf4aab59021d051c0076fb315c26_3.png)

- en: Conft numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a+ B。 where A and B are real
    numbers and I is a unit imaginary number。 which equals to square root of minus1。So
    now that we have established what complex numbers are。 let's talk a little about
    where they are used。Complex numbers of applications in a variety of fields。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: especially ones in math， physics and engineering quantum mechanics and signal
    processing are some of the examples you might be familiar with。 and thanks to
    Euler who came up with this amazing formula as shown on the screen that relates
    in imaginary number to sine and cosine terms so for example。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this relationship can be used to rewrite a standard cosine wave equation as
    a product of two complex exponentials and this often simplifies a math involved
    since complex exponentials are easier to manipulate than their sinusoidal counterparts。😊，We
    can also get benefit from complex numbers in the field of deep learning。

- en: Recent work on neural nets and older fundamental theoretical analysis suggests
    that complex numbers could have a rich representational capacity before Pytorch's
    lack of native complex support made it harder than it had to be to unlock that
    potential and at Pytororch we're about empowering research in our users our philosophy
    is to make things easy to use and to get the hard things out of users way So as
    we've been receiving a request for complex number support。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we decided to do something about it。 Here are some of the request from the Pytorge
    discussion forum that we have received over the years。 we're going to talk about
    some of these things listed here later。 but what I would really like to emphasize
    on is that this is a community drivenn project and we prioritize the features
    weve built based on the ongoing feedback from the community as well with the community
    to do the actual development。

- en: So what we heard from the community boils down to three main points。 which were
    the motivation behind adding native complex support。 First is natural representation。
    Historically， we represented complex numbers as a tuple of two real numbers。 but
    we heard from many users。 that was just plain exhausting to write code with that
    convention。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so we wanted to introduce an API that makes working with complex numbers
    in Pytorrch easier。 as well as makes the code more maintainable。 Second， is complex
    functionality。 If would like to provide nuy like support for complex operations
    and leverage Pytorch's ability to run with accelerators。😊，So far， we've also added
    many specialized kernels on both CPUU and GPU to optimize complex operations。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in fact on CPUU we also support recization for complex operations。And third
    is autograd。 as I mentioned before， we want to support neuralNe research。 and
    so we're working to add complex autograd support， which is helpful in optimization
    problems。![](img/30cfbf4aab59021d051c0076fb315c26_7.png)

- en: Those of you who view spectrallos in Pytorch before might be familiar with the
    code on the right。 the display tensor shows how we have historically represented
    complex numbers in torch。 As you can see it looks bulky， ugly and hard to read。
    and there's really no good reason to not have complex data types in torch。 so
    in Pytorch 1。6。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we introduced two native complex D types， complex 64 and complex 128。 which
    correspond to float and double data types。I would also like to mention here that
    the functions in the newly added towards 15 module。 which Michael will talk about
    later support complex numbers。Now another good thing about having native complex
    support is that you no longer have to write all the annoying time consuming and
    error prone workarounds which used to be necessary。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and with our latest release， many common operations like Mamall， SVD。 etc are
    available for our complex number users。We've also added support for core properties
    as well as Tensa constructors to have natural complex number support that you
    may be familiar with from Ny and Python。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and on their right is an example of a Facebook code of function written using
    the native complex support。The details of the code are not really important， it's
    really to tell that we're constantly adding functionality to prioritize use cases
    that our community finds valuable。

- en: Here are some examples of the operators we have added so far。 as you can see
    we have added support for many linear algebra ops。 trignometric ops and algebraic
    ops， and we're constantly working to add more。![](img/30cfbf4aab59021d051c0076fb315c26_14.png)

- en: And it doesn't stop there， with the latest release， you can also differentiate
    complex functions。![](img/30cfbf4aab59021d051c0076fb315c26_16.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For those of you who are familiar with complex differentiation。 we compute the
    conjugate wording derivatives For those of you who are not but just want to be
    able to use optimizers with complex parameters。 we got you covered with a gradientd
    convention the existing optimizers work out of the box with a common case of optimizing
    real valued objective and in case you are just curious to write custom gradient
    functions you can check out our complex autograd documentation on our website。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And that's where we stand today， going forward， we're actively working to a
    and distribute computing support。 which would help us deliver performance wins
    bigger than before。😊。We're also expanding complex operator coverage and working
    to add native complex support to torch audio。 which uses a lot of complex numbers。

- en: So I hope we got you excited about using conflict numbers in Pytorch。 We had
    the documentation up on our website to get you started， So try it， give us feedback。
    let us know what you think and really every bit of feedback we get like every
    bug report and every you know this was weird and we didn't really understand why
    this happened is really valuable to us we also have a lot of interesting ongoing
    discussions at Github like conflict support for To N N modules that you can get
    involved in Finally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you would like to request new functionality or join the amazing community
    of contributors check us out on Github。 we're constantly monitoring the complex
    table on Github。 So filing new issues and engaging in discussions is a great way
    to let us know what youd like to see in the upcoming releases。 I would like to
    bring this presentation to a close by giving a shout out to our amazing open source
    contributors and thanking them for adding a lot of conflict support to Pytorch。
