    you're taking this class through Washington University。 I'm going to talk about
    obviously how you submit assignments and all that sort of thing is currently being
    offered online and in a hybrid format in the hybrid format you show a for time
    at the campus and the rest is remote if you're in the purely online version everything's
    the same except you watch the videos pre-recorded or you can join in live if you
    so desired Now if you're just tuning into this from the internet through YouTube
    everything is available to you except you really can't submit assignments or get
    individual help and guidance from me like the actual students at Washington University
    so the previous semester we taught this class in a completely online format I've
    been doing this throughout COVID this semester were actually。

  zh: 🎼所以在这个视频中，我将开始课程，介绍它。如果你是通过华盛顿大学上这门课，我将讨论如何提交作业等内容。目前以在线和混合形式提供，在混合形式中，你会在校园上课一次，其他时间是远程的。如果你是纯在线版本，一切都是一样的，除了你观看的是预录视频，或者如果你希望，可以参加直播。如果你只是通过YouTube在网上收看，所有内容都对你开放，只是你不能提交作业或获得我像实际学生那样的个别帮助和指导。上学期我们以完全在线的形式教授这门课程，我一直在COVID期间这样做，而这一学期我们实际上…

    the plan is that this course will meet at the Danfor University campus。At WashU
    four times during the semester Now I'm going to broadcast that through Zoom and
    it will be available recorded as well。 so I'm not making class attendance mandatory。
    this semester for those four in session meetings We'll talk more about that at
    the first meeting and in the zoom So all of the information about this course

    this stuff is stored。 This is my page at WashU I probably need to update my picture

    it's going to look basically like this All of the videos are available either
    through YouTube or through Calaltura。They're exactly the same videos you can watch
    it through whichever one you desire。 One thing that's neat about these is the

    on the readings。 It's going to take you outside of canvas and go to Github and
    this is what you see if you access it just straight through the internet really
    everything in this course is available on Jupiter notebooks and Jupiter notebooks

    Notebooks中获得，而Jupyter Notebooks是进行深度学习的一个很好的方式。
- en: 😊，GPU available Well， you don't need to， but some of the stuff in that I'll
    show you in this course actually will not work only with a CPU。 Now the computer
    I have behind me has a fairly highend GPU on it。 I use that the Mac that I'm actually
    using right now， it's kind of an exciting time for Mac。 you can now use the M1
    if you have one of the newer Mac to be able to use a GPU or an accelerator to
    make use of the highs speed mathematical computations that you need really for
    deep learning。

  zh: 😊，虽然你不需要GPU，但我将在本课程中向你展示的一些内容实际上只用CPU是无法工作的。现在我身后这台电脑有一个相当高端的GPU。我正在使用的这台Mac也是，正是目前Mac的一个激动人心的时刻。如果你有新款的Mac，现在可以使用M1，以便能够使用GPU或加速器来利用深度学习所需的高速数学计算。
- en: I have a video showing you how to set up an M1 Mac exactly like you need for
    this course and then also if you're using Linux or Windows。 you can also use the
    GPU in either of those you do need an Nvidia type GPU because Kuta is required
    for Tensorflow Kis。

    your system。What I very much recommend。And really， if you don't want to go through

    the Jupiter notebooks that I have on this course have a link here at the top that

- en: I am using Google Collab Pro， It's about $10 a month not needed for this course
    when we get into the Cagel competition。 it will give you an unfair advantage and
    not unfair in the sense of it's not fair allowed you're allowed to use it and
    some of the students do use Google Coab Pro during the Cale competition to have
    access to a faster GPU you'll also have a really good GPU available to you inside
    of CaGgle but we'll get more to the Caaggle as we go through the first class session。

  zh: 我在使用Google Collab Pro，每月大约$10，这个课程并不需要它，但当我们进入Kaggle比赛时，它会给你带来不公平的优势，这里的“不公平”指的是它是允许的，你可以使用它，一些学生在Kaggle比赛期间确实使用Google
    Collab Pro，以获得更快的GPU，你在Kaggle内部也会有一个很好的GPU可用，但我们会在第一次课堂上进一步讨论Kaggle。
- en: So you can see that all of it is available here。 you can run these various parts。
    Most of the first course module is just introductory material there's not too
    much code until you get to the very end So if you run this portion of the code
    this is what checks to see that your GPU is actually available for you and you
    see the little spinning thing there it's spinning and it will tell you if the
    GPU is available or not available it'll tell you the version of Tensorflow that
    you're dealing with so here it is Tensorflow of 2。

  zh: 所以你可以看到所有内容都在这里可用。你可以运行这些不同的部分。第一个课程模块大部分只是介绍性的材料，直到最后才有很多代码。所以如果你运行这部分代码，这会检查你的GPU是否真的可用，你会看到那个小的旋转标志，它正在旋转，并会告诉你GPU是否可用，以及你正在使用的TensorFlow版本，所以这里是TensorFlow
    2。
- en: 5 which is what I tested all the code on for this semester since the GPU is
    not available what that means you need to do and collab is go down to change runtime
    type turn on your GPU it's going restart your virtual machine which is fine Now
    we go ahead and run it and your GPU should be available Yep GPU is available that
    will considerably increase the processing speed on all of this。

  zh: 5是我这个学期测试所有代码的版本。由于GPU不可用，这意味着你需要在collab中向下更改运行时类型，启用你的GPU，它会重启你的虚拟机，这没问题。现在我们继续运行，它的GPU应该可用，是的，GPU可用了，这将大大提高所有处理的速度。

    I will say the Mac M1 support is quite new。 I've only had this Mac M1 myself for
    about a month but I'm running through all of the course material on M1 and fixing

    machine learning。 you get the output from cases in the past where you know， so
    you've got labeled data。 perhaps maybe you've got a bunch of images a cats and
    dogs and you have them labeled cat and dog you put that into the computer and
    it gives you the program code。 The program code is the neural network。 So this
    is called datadriven development。

- en: and this alleviates you from having to write a lot of the code to tell the difference
    between a cat and a dog because that would be very very difficult for traditional
    programming。 these are the three areas that I really see deep learning used a
