HiÔºå this is Jeff Heaton„ÄÇ Welcome to applications of deep neural networks of Washington University„ÄÇ

 WellÔºå is that time of the semester AgainÔºå It is time for the 2020 spring kle competition for my class„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå this semesterÔºå it's going to be on computer vision„ÄÇ

 This is the first time we've done computer vision„ÄÇ So I'm excited about this„ÄÇ

 we did natural language processing„ÄÇ Last timeÔºå I think this is a great deep learning applicable technology in this one„ÄÇ

 we're gonna look at facesÔºå and we're going to see if we can detect if they're wearing glasses or not„ÄÇ

 NowÔºå these are faces that I generated with Gs„ÄÇ So we're going to use the latent vectors of the Gs to try to detect eyewear„ÄÇ

 as well as the images themselves to see all my videos about kggle neural networks and other AI topics„ÄÇ

Where I have the kle„ÄÇ I swear copy on page searching has made me lazy„ÄÇ So I usually do that8Ôºå5„ÄÇ

 And there's always a link here to the current semesters kle competition„ÄÇ

 spring 2020 kle assignment I just put this up you click on that and go into here Now mine says this competition hasn't been launched only host and kgel andmins can see it„ÄÇ

 you won't have this here because I will have open this by the time that I release this video but this is the competition„ÄÇ

 What we are doing this semester is a computer vision competition„ÄÇ And it's also related to Gs„ÄÇ

 So I am giving you a bunch of pictures and in those pictures you will see faces like this what I am having you do is predict if that face has glasses on it„ÄÇ

 Now you need to be careful with that because glasses can look a variety of different ways you can have sunglasses you can have sunglasses where you„ÄÇ

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_7.png)

Even see his eyes„ÄÇ you can have sunglasses where you can kind of see his eyes„ÄÇ

 You can have thicker framesÔºå thinner framesÔºå and you can have really thin frames„ÄÇ

 I wear this kind of glasses myself„ÄÇ And at first glance„ÄÇ

 you might not think that she even has glasses on„ÄÇ but if you zoom in on her„ÄÇ you'll see that yes„ÄÇ

 there are glassesÔºå they're just veryÔºå very faint„ÄÇ I hope the video Koc for this video doesn't prevent you from seeing those„ÄÇ

 but that is essentially what we're doing„ÄÇ Now one thing that I want to mention for this competition„ÄÇ

 you will be submitting your code to meÔºå or at least if you're a student at Washington University„ÄÇ

 you'll submit your code to me„ÄÇ And one thing that I am taking off the table„ÄÇ

 And I asked if you're joining from the InternetÔºå you don't do this either„ÄÇ There's only„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ



![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_9.png)

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_10.png)

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_11.png)

A couple thousand or so pictures in the test set that you're submitting„ÄÇ

 it would not be hard to just sit there and flip through all the pictures and label them glasses„ÄÇ

 No glasses„ÄÇ use your human brainÔºå your biological neural network„ÄÇ

 everybody knows you can do that that won't be that that valuable really„ÄÇ So don't do that„ÄÇ

 you probably would not get a perfect score due to noise in the data„ÄÇ

 which will be talking about in a moment„ÄÇ So let's look at the evaluation for this„ÄÇ

 you'll be evaluated using a log loss function„ÄÇ So the data set basically as a one„ÄÇ

 if they have glasses a 0 if they do not have glasses„ÄÇ

 You're going to send a probability of whether you think they have glasses or not„ÄÇ

 you'll be graded on log loss„ÄÇ So if you're very confident like it says here if you are very confident that it's not somebody with glasses in your term just a 0„ÄÇ

12„ÄÇ and the label was actually one that'll be a fairly high loss for that individual person submission format„ÄÇ

üòä„ÄÇ

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_13.png)

be like this you'll see in these files that we're going to download in a moment that there are ID numbers„ÄÇ

 All of the training set goes up to 4500„ÄÇ The test set goes from 4501 onward rules you can create teams up to five members you may not human label the data you've got to use a model So don't just sit there and go through all of my images and label them glasses„ÄÇ

 no glassesÔºå glassesÔºå glasses everybody knows you can do that that doesn't really accomplish that much if this was a real kggle with a lot of money on it the way I would solve that as I would give you a punishingly large number of images with noise images in there in large degrees as well so don't don't do that and if you're in if you're in the top position in a kle competition you've got to submit your model anyway and if your model is a hardcoded list of zeros and ones you're probably not going to win anything which„ÄÇ

me2 prizes„ÄÇ This competition in kle„ÄÇ I meanÔºå it's a kle in class„ÄÇ

 so it doesn't count towards ti or rankings or anything like that„ÄÇ

 There are no tangible prizes other than bragging rights„ÄÇ HoweverÔºå and this is more for my students„ÄÇ

 although somebody from the outside gets in this position„ÄÇ

 I'll probably I would do this as well for the teams in position one through three„ÄÇ

 I will write you a really good LinkedIn recommendation saying how you were one of the top contestants out of'll probably be 80 or so people competing in this„ÄÇ

 at least for Warho this semester„ÄÇ NowÔºå the challenge for me in creating these kind of data sets is I never create a data set on Kagel with data that is just publicly available on the Internet that's no fun because there's all kinds of code and everything published for this„ÄÇ

 There's a number of kggles that might help you with this one„ÄÇ

 The cat or dog might be kind of useful„ÄÇ Several techniques you can use for these„ÄÇ



![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_15.png)

That I'll get into and I'll probably release some code as the semester goes on just to give you a few hints„ÄÇ

 I won't release anything over the top„ÄÇ powerful for for getting really high on the leader board„ÄÇ

 And of course the rule to is like I saidÔºå no no sitting there and human tagging them„ÄÇ

 Now if you can teach your cat to tag them„ÄÇ Okay no no cats either„ÄÇ

 So we'll go from there data So the data for this competition„ÄÇ

 there's a big file here basically its round 6 gig„ÄÇ So it's not punishingly large„ÄÇ

 That' has all of the images in it„ÄÇ If you were to download it„ÄÇ

 let me show you what that file looks like„ÄÇ This is the image file„ÄÇ

 So it's a big zip file that has all of these PGs„ÄÇ there are quite a few of them„ÄÇ

 if you go through all of themÔºå you will see that there's around 5000 So around 500„ÄÇ

 I guess it looks like is what the test set is made of„ÄÇ If you go through these individuals„ÄÇ

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_18.png)

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_19.png)

You'll see that some have glassesÔºå some do not„ÄÇ Some have sunglasses„ÄÇ

 and you have a variety of gendersÔºå ethnic backgrounds and facial hair„ÄÇ's hats„ÄÇ

 There's a lot lot of variety in these images Now as far as how to actually classify these„ÄÇ

 You really have two ways to go about this„ÄÇ You can use the images„ÄÇ or you can use thegan vectors„ÄÇ

 I'll show you thegan vectors in just a moment„ÄÇ but let's talk about a few ways that you might deal with these images„ÄÇ

 You could write just a simple classifier that is going to tell you if the person has glasses or does not You're going to go to classifier route„ÄÇ

 I highly suggest that you use transfer learning and use a data that already has a lot of features already learned and then try to train it on top of it„ÄÇ

 I think that's going to work the best„ÄÇ you can also use Yolo Yolo looking at this„ÄÇ

 it would be interesting„ÄÇHonestly haven't tried itÔºå but run Yolo over it„ÄÇ

 see if it identifies these pieces of the glasses or the glasses themselves as anything„ÄÇ

 I probably should have tried that first„ÄÇ I don't think Yolo is gonna necessarily just lock in 100% on this„ÄÇ

 but who knows if if Yolo is is the key to the kingdom on this one that might be the case„ÄÇ

 but there's several several levels of this„ÄÇ Now let me show you what the training and sample and those files look like if you download them„ÄÇ

 if you go over here to data each of these images does have a vector that goes with it 512 numbers if the that is what you feed to thevidia style again to actually generate that face„ÄÇ

 So these numbers generated this face and the background for that matter Now you might be able to use these 512 numbers„ÄÇ

 and honestly that would be really if you can create a„ÄÇ

preredctor that uses just these numbers and no image to really accurately predict glasses or not that that would be really pretty cool„ÄÇ

 I would be very interested in in how you did that and we could possibly even do some sort„ÄÇ

 maybe a medium publication or or something like that„ÄÇ

 I would definitely work with you on that if you wanted to let's see what these file and you can do both„ÄÇ

 you can use the the vector and the images as well Now when you go to the data page down here„ÄÇ

 it shows you the files„ÄÇ So let's look at sample real quick„ÄÇ This is a sample submission„ÄÇ



![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_21.png)

![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_22.png)

So this is a sample„ÄÇ you can see the 4500Ôºå and then for this sampleÔºå I just predicted 0„ÄÇ64„ÄÇ

 which is the percentage of these people overall that have glassesÔºå which matches a general„ÄÇ

 the general population sampleÔºå at least in the United States„ÄÇ

 and you can see there's about 500 of these„ÄÇ so definitely don't go through and simply label these„ÄÇ

 Now let's look at the training data„ÄÇ This is the training data„ÄÇSo in the training data„ÄÇ

 this portion hereÔºå that's quite long„ÄÇ This is the vector„ÄÇ So this is your latent vector„ÄÇ

 so there's 512 of those„ÄÇ and then there's the label glasses 0110 Now I generated all of this this data I did not sit here and generate hand create 5000 of these individuals and then labeled them manually„ÄÇ

 and that's part of the challenge of potentially using this vector to actually figure out who has glasses and who does not because these numbers for the data that was generated by an algorithm of mine„ÄÇ

 And I have another video on how that algorithm works„ÄÇ

 So if you want to do something serious with these vectors here you probably want to watch that other video but you'll see literally how I created this training set and how I was able to generategan vector„ÄÇ

That had a very high likelihood of being people with glasses or people without„ÄÇ NowÔºå notice„ÄÇ

 I say very high likelihood„ÄÇ The data is not perfect„ÄÇ So I'm telling you this ahead of time„ÄÇ

 I was thinking about just letting you discover it„ÄÇ But I would get a bunch of email„ÄÇ

 saying your data is incorrectÔºå because I'm seeing people in here that you say have glasses that do not and vice versa„ÄÇ

 So let's just take a look at this„ÄÇ I took it down to just the Id in the glasses„ÄÇ



![](img/c86fcbcc05423ffdaef7f9ffa84b9b4f_24.png)

And now we've got both up at once„ÄÇ So let's just kind of validate the data„ÄÇ OkayÔºå person 1„ÄÇ

 no glassesÔºå glassesÔºå glasses„ÄÇ So see those two ones over there„ÄÇ No glasses„ÄÇ no glasses„ÄÇ

 So two nose in a rowÔºå1Ôºå2Ôºå3 glassesÔºå no glasses„ÄÇ OkayÔºå and then yeahÔºå that's person 10„ÄÇ

 person 10 has glassesÔºå noneÔºå1Ôºå OkayÔºå there's probably an error 15Ôºå No 15 is 15 is fine„ÄÇ OkayÔºå so 19„ÄÇ

OkayÔºå I had to flip through quite a few of these to actually find one„ÄÇ but this one is wrong„ÄÇ So 30„ÄÇ

 it says this person should have glasses„ÄÇ They do not„ÄÇ

 So this is my I'm essentially doing the opposite of what I asked you to do„ÄÇ

 I asked you to look at vectors or look at images and tell me if they have glasses or not„ÄÇ

 My challenge to myself when I was researchinggans and working on this was I tried to write an algorithm that generated a bunch of vectors that were either glasses or no„ÄÇ

 I just pure math„ÄÇ NoÔºå even looking at the images„ÄÇ And my algorithm is pretty accurate„ÄÇ

 I went through about 30 of these before I found one that was that was not correct„ÄÇ

 So I had asked my algorithm to generate this person with glassesÔºå but it did not„ÄÇ

 So even if you build a perfect classifier„ÄÇ So you sit there with your teammates and label all of these which you're not supposed to do„ÄÇ

 but sit there and put in„ÄÇüòäÔºåA a1 or a zero completely on your own with no neural network whatsoever„ÄÇ

 you still wouldn't get a perfect score because you would using your human brain would have said this person does not have glasses My algorithm„ÄÇ

 assume assume that you would So if you want to get the absolute highest scores„ÄÇ

 there's almost two levels to this challenge First level is just figuring out from the vectors or from the images who has glasses who do not have glasses and then the second if you truly want to even conquer the noise„ÄÇ

 then you could potentially try to figure out which of these individuals were misclassified maybe their vectors are close to each other in high dimension space„ÄÇ

 maybe clustering would figure out I'm honestly not sure I have not tried to analyze it„ÄÇ

If you watch my other video on looking into the latent vector„ÄÇ

 and I'll put a link to it in in this competition description link„ÄÇ

 you might get some clues into how you would do this„ÄÇ So in theory„ÄÇ

 you could potentially get a perfect zero log loss without hand labeling„ÄÇ

 And even if you hand labeled againÔºå you're not supposed to„ÄÇ But if you did„ÄÇ

 you would still not get a perfect score because you would get these wrong„ÄÇ I think there might„ÄÇ

 I think there are clues in the vectors„ÄÇ I would think that there in some sort of high dimensional space close to each other„ÄÇ

 but I'm not not entirely sure„ÄÇ watch the other videoÔºå youÔºå you'll see more about that„ÄÇ All right„ÄÇ

 So that is this semester's competitionÔºå you have any questionsÔºå leave them in the feedback„ÄÇ

 if you have any questionsÔºå leave them in the comments and good luck on this semester's competition„ÄÇ

 HopefullyÔºå I made it neither too easy„ÄÇüòäÔºåOr punishingly hard„ÄÇ So always my goal„ÄÇ
