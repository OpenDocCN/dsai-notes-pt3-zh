    And this video is one in a series that I've made about Excel。 So if you haven't
    watched my other Excel tutorials， please do so as soon as humanly possible。 But
    in this particular video， what we're going to be doing is looking at how to split
    names。

- en: And this is a common problem in Excel。 Maybe you're working in a worksheet like
    this one which has people's last names followed by a comma。 and then their first
    names。 And this is very， very common when working with data。 and it's kind of
    nice to have it this way， you can sort and alphabetize this information because
    it's listed as last name comma first name。 It's pretty nice。 But from time to
    time， it becomes important to separate these out and put the first name in column
    B。

- en: for example， And how do you do that if you don't want to go into each cell one
    at a time and delete and then copy paste and put in the first name over here in
    column。![](img/29d093560c283260280d0e2e9f8c3daf_1.png)

- en: how do I separate these out？ Another common problem is having data like this。
    First name， space。 last name。 And in some ways， this is even worse， because it
    makes alphabetizing by last name very difficult。 Okay， so let's look at how to
    solve these problems。 I'm going to go back in to my first example。 Last name comma
    first name。 And like I said this is not terrible。
  prefs: []

- en: But what if I wanted to find out how many people in this list have the first
    name of Jonathan or have the first name of Mary or whatever。 It would be hard
    to do that with the first name and last name in the same column。 So the way to
    solve this problem is to click on the column letter that would be column a in
    this case。 And then all I have to do is make sure I'm on the data tab the data
    ribbon。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I go to the data tools group and look for text to columns。 I just click
    on that。 and I get a pop up that appears， it's the convert text to columns wizard。There's
    three steps first step is I have to choose which of these two descriptions best
    describes my data I it delimited characters such as commas or tabs separate each
    field so let's think about this Is it true that I have commas or tabs separating
    each field Yeah I do I have commas between each one of these So I'm going to stick
    with delimited and then I'll click next and then it says this screen lets you
    set the delimiters your data contains and by default it's got tab selected I'm
    going to uncheck tab and then I'll just go down and choose comma and as soon as
    I did that notice what happened it showed me down here a data preview and it showed
    me that it's going work Now before I click next。

- en: notice that it says treat consecutive delimiters as one so for example space
    there is also a space between the last name and the first name and I will have
    this checked treat consecutive delimiters as。OneAnd so what that should do is
    it should get rid of this extra space between them。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So now I'll click next and now if I want to， I can set the column data format。
    So I want to leave it as just general text but if I wanted to I could specify
    it specifically as text or as a date and I could choose the format for that date
    that I want to use So I'll just leave it at general and I'll click finish and
    look what it did。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's successfully split the names。 the last names are here。 the first names
    are here。 it got rid of the commas and it got rid of the extra space with one
    exception。 It looks like Eselle had two spaces between her last name。 the comma
    and the first name and so I'm just going to delete that and now I've got perfectly
    split names let's look now at the other problem first and last names and the only
    thing separating them is a space it's almost the same I just click here on the
    column letter and then I go to data text to columns again it's really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Delimitted again。 so I'll click next this time instead of comma， I'll just check
    space。 I can uncheck treat consecutive delimiters as one in this case。 and then
    I'll just click next。 I don't really want to change any of this。 I'll click finish
    and it splits those names perfectly。 Now that I've done this Now that I've split
    the names。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: If I wanted the last name to be in the first column。 It's easy to do。 All I
    need to do is go here to column a right click in the column letter and cut and
    then go over to column C right click and paste。 and you can see what that did。
    it just copy pasted the first name from column A to column C。 I could even just
    right click now on a and delete that entire column and now I've got last names
    in column A first names in column B。

- en: So text to columns really is pretty simple， pretty easy。 but it's a nice Excel
    feature that a lot of people don't know exist。 So thanks for watching。 I hope
