    1。 and I'm going to say section number one。Pieces of a matte plot lib。Graph。To
    start off with。 I want to be nice and explicit here that we， so that we see exactly
    what we're plotting。 So I'm going to say x， let's just create some data to plot。
    So I'm going to say x equals。
  prefs: []

- en: and I'm going to create a list here。 negative 3， negative 2， negative 1，0，1，2，3。
    We could also do this with a range function in Python。 That's totally fine。 And
    I'm going to import。😊，Numpy as in P while we're at it， because matpl Lib usually
    expects a nuy array and a nuy array。 if you haven't worked with nuumpy much before。Is，

- en: you can basically think about it like a list or a matrix。 So you can have a
    one dimensional array。 which is just a list， or you can have a two dimensional
    array。 which is more like a matrix with rows and columns。 and you can have three
    dimensional arrays and things like that so。

- en: I'm going to create x equals in P dot array， negative 3 up to positive 3。And
    now， let's， for our why。Let's create x squared。 So we're just going to do a simple。X
    and y squared thing here。 So if we look at x， we have our array， negative 3 up
    to positive 3。 And if we look at y， well。 we just squared every single number
    here。 So 9，4，1，0，1，4，9， etc ceter。

    to recommend。 You always use when your when you're starting out， there are other
    ways to do it。 but we're not going to talk about those right now。 We're just going
    to give you。 I'm going to give you a formula。That you can use to plot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I recommend that you always do it this way for now。 So to start off with。You're
    going to say fig and x equals PLT。 subplots。And then you're going to do all of
    your plotting code here。 So do your plotting code here。You know dot dot dot， so
    this is where you're actually going to say what you want to plot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    for figure and as。 aes， not ais， but aes。 this is kind of a confusing thing we'll
    talk about in just a minute。 Fig x equals PLT subplots。We'll do PlT。how and now
    our plotting。A code that we're going to do first is just x dot plot， X and y。

    actually kind of a little choppy。 It's actually， you know， kind of ugly。 But with
    this just a little bit of code here， we're able to produce graphs。 And this is
    pretty cool。 And from here， we're going to add on complexity layer by layer。😊。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But this is the foundation of plotting and mapplotlib。 You always instantiate
    your figure and your axes。 You always want to end it with Plt。 show unless you're
    saving out saving out a file rather than displaying it here。 And then in the middle，
    this is where you're gonna to do all your plotting。 And you can have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you know， you could have one line here to plot this or you you could have 100
    lines to do all kinds of crazy formatting。So this is a good place to tell you，
    what do these terms actually mean， And to do that。 we're going to go to the handy
    dandy， Matt plot Lib。

- en: So this is what a matte plot lib。Graph is or a map plotlib figure。 And if you
    understand what it is。 this is going to help you with plotting。So let's talk about
    the main pieces here。The figure。 the figure。 So you know， it this circle here
    pointing to just what looks like a blank patch of nothingness。That's because the
    figure， the maplalib figure is this whole graph。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it doesn't matter how complex your graph is。 It doesn't matter how many different
    lines you have in here and how many different points。 And you can have， you can
    actually have lots of little different graphs in here as well。 The whole thing
    is called the figure。Now， within a figure， you'll notice right beside it here，
    aes。 A X， E， aes。This is。What we might think of as being the graph itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the figure is where you're going to put all of your graphs。And then the a
    Cs。Is going to be kind of the plot itself with an X axis and a y axis and some
    lines and some points and all this kind of stuff。![](img/77d641e47cdae93cdad4881dd7e907b0_14.png)

- en: To make this a little bit more clear。Let's come back over here。And I'm going
    to show you now。What it looks like to have a single figure。A single figure with
    two axes。 So subpls。And in this case。 I am going to do one row。Of two columns
    of axes。And I'll explain this in just a second。But。

    image here。 You see how I can kind of click and drag that image。 So this is like
    a single image file that you could download here。 That whole thing is your figure。Now，
    your axes， A X， E， S。This is going to be this plot。 So this plot right here is
    one axes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This plot over here is another axes。 So we have two axes。 and this is what I
    created here。 I created one， which is the number of rows of axes that I wanted。And
    two。 which is the number of columns of axes that I wanted。And then I took each
    one of those axes。 and I plotted on it。And this is why， up here。

    3， negative 2。 negative 1。 That's your x。 and then 0。![](img/77d641e47cdae93cdad4881dd7e907b0_20.png)

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So down here， we have a single figure still， but now we have two axes。All right。Now。
    within each a Cs with an ES， and this is very confusing。 they probably could have
    done a better job naming things here。![](img/77d641e47cdae93cdad4881dd7e907b0_24.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have your ex axis。And your y axis。 So this might be what we typically think
    of as an axis。And then for each access there， you can have an access label。 you
    have access tick marks。You have grid lines on that axis。And then same thing for
    your Y axis up here。 And then you have your actual plots so you can have a line
    plot。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We have。X ses1， which has its own X axis and its own y axis。 And maybe to make
    this clear。 let's plot x cubed on the second one here。So x cubed is now going
    to be in this axes over here。So you see that each one has its own x axis， x axis
    and its own y axis。Each one has its own lines。 its own line objects in here。And
    this is all wrapped up in a single figure。 Alright。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I hope that that's helpful。 We create。 first off， we create the figure。And
    we create the axes。 and then we plot things on the axes themselves， and then finally，
    whenever we're done。 getting all of our stuff to plot， we show it， we show the
    graph。Okay， so hopefully。 this is somewhat clear for you， at least I think that
    people honestly use Matplotlib for years without ever looking at this figure here
    and seeing what all the different pieces are。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    you can have multiple axes which are where you actually do the graphing。![](img/77d641e47cdae93cdad4881dd7e907b0_28.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    going to do your line plots。 your scatter plots with your markers， etc and just
    to really， really drive this home。![](img/77d641e47cdae93cdad4881dd7e907b0_30.png)

    of subplots。I'm going to make a two by two grid of subplots。 And let's just plot
    this。 Let's show this before we do any plotting on the axes themselves。 So I'm
    going to create a comment here and just see say， create a figure。With four axes。嗯。2。
  prefs: []

- en: And here we go。 You'll see that we have a single figure。 So if I want to drag
    this， you know。 you see that that's kind of just like a single image there。And
    we have four different axes。 We have a two by two grid of axes。 Each one of those
    axes has its own x axis and its own y axis。 and we can plot whatever we want。On
    these axes。 and this object。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the AX S that it returns in this case， since we have a two by2 grid is actually
    also going to be a2 by2 nuy array for us to plot on So to plots。 I'm going to

    the zeroth column。 So this one， and then the first row and the first column， this
    one over here。We could also plot things on。0，1。And。1，0。 And I'm doing all of this，
    by the way。So let's。 let's maybe do an x to the fourth。 And what do you think
    like a。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

- en: So you see， we've got four different graphs now。In four different axes。 and
    they're all inside of a single figure。So。Everything inside of a single。Figure。Alright。
    so the reason why I'm really， I'm really trying to drive this home right now is
    because everything else。 everything else that you do in Mattpl Lib。Is going to
    rely on you understanding these axes objects and the fact that you're plotting
    on these axes objects。

    yet， you might be thinking to yourself， okay。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    that we're actually going to get to in just a minute。So before we move on。 I want
    to show you one last thing while we're here。 And that's。 that's the fact that
    you might notice that these graphs are pretty choppy， right， You're like， oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: well， this doesn't look like a very pretty parabola。 It's kind of choppy or
    all the graphs going to be this ugly。 And the answer is， no。 the answer is that
    the graphs are choppy because these are the only points we gave to plot to matpl
    lib。To， to plot。So to make this to make this very clear。

    scatter plot。 That's the scatter plot。So with the scatter plot， you can really
    see it now that we have only defined x and y points。 Remember， we've only defined
    x and y points x。And y 4，7 data points total。 So we've got3 in the negative。 We
