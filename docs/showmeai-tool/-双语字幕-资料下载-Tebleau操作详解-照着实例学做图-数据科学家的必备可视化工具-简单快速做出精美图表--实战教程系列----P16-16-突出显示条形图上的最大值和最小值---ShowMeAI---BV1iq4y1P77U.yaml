- en: Hi， folks， and welcome to another episode of Tableau in two minutes。 Today。
    we're going to walk through how to highlight the minimum and maximum values in
    a bar chart。 If you watched the previous video， you may have seen how we did this
    for a line chart。 and it was a little bit complicated。 We had to do some funky
    stuff with some dual axes and create a table calculation and all that sort of
    fun stuff。

    gonna to go ahead and drag order date。😊。![](img/65ef3ad18e55e2be53811e4fb3562acc_1.png)

    And then we're going to take sales， drag sales out onto the row shelf。 And then
    we're going to go ahead and set this to be a bar chart instead of a line chart。![](img/65ef3ad18e55e2be53811e4fb3562acc_4.png)

- en: And you can see already that we've gone ahead。 and the colors have already been
    set for us based on the maximum and based on the minimum。 But let's go ahead and
    edit this as we did before。 We're just going to compute this within each year。
    So we're going to set specific dimensions。 We're going to take out year。 Now you
    can see that。

    let's go ahead and look at this calculation。 You can see that。![](img/65ef3ad18e55e2be53811e4fb3562acc_12.png)

- en: Some of sales。 Sorry， we're looking for the maximum value when the sum of sales
    in any particular month equals the window max for the sum of sales。 Now， we set
    the window。To be a full year。 So in this case， the full year 2014， that is our
    window。 And if the sum of sales in that particular month equals the maximum sum
    of sales within that window。 which it does in September。 Then we're going to call
    that the max and the max。

- en: Otherwise， if the sum of sales is the lowest value。Within that window。All right。
    so it still within 2014。To February， that's the lowest value within the minute，
    the the window。 Then we're going to call that min。 and we're going highlight it
    red。Otherwise。 all of the other ones we don't particularly care about。

- en: You can use this in any number of ways to pull out specific values。So， again。
    super helpful way of highlighting the maximum and minimum values。 a great way
    of using colour to bring some pop to dashboard and helping demonstrate when a
    particularly impactful or unimpactful as it were a month was。😊，Thanks for watching
    this episode of Tableau in two minutes。 If you have any questions。
