- en: And that is pretty much it for our Jupiter notebook tutorial here。 So I want
    to leave you with a couple other resources。 I'm not gonna go into into too much
    depth here because I think you've gotten a really good foundation that you can
    start with。 but I want to make you aware of these， in case they are helpful for
    what you want to do with Jupyter notebooks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the first tool which is part of the Jupiter notebooks installation， I believe
    is in be convert。 So notebook convert here。 So this basically helps you convert
    notebooks to other formats。 like it says here， very helpfully。 you can convert
    to Pdfs， you can convert to latex Hml， etc ceter。 This can be very， very handy。
    The second resource I want to point you to is in B format。

- en: So if you Google in B format and then click here the Jupyter notebook format
    and specifically this Python API for working with notebook files。![](img/fada9b10c7f63ddff8bee1e0b3c83e54_3.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is also something that just comes with your Jupyter notebook installation。And
    this is a way to programmatically work with notebook files within Python scripts。
    So。 for example， imagine that you want to create a certain type of Jupyter notebook。
    Maybe you want to create。Various code cells and different kinds of markdown cells
    based on the type of data that you have。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you， you have some logic for how you want to create the Jupyter notebook
    itself。 Well。 in B format can help you do that。Additionally， you can read in existing
    notebooks and edit them and then save them back out as Jupiter notebooks。 So this
    is very， very helpful for programmatically working with different Jupiter notebooks。

- en: And this resource here， combined with this next one， paper mill can be a very
    powerful combination。So paper mill does not come with Jupiter Notes natively，
    you have to install it separately。![](img/fada9b10c7f63ddff8bee1e0b3c83e54_7.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But paper mill lets you parameterize notebooks and execute notebooks。 So whenever
    I say parameterize。This means passing variables into the notebook。So let's say
    that you have an experiment inside of a Jupyter notebook and you want to run it
    with different sets of parameters。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， you can use paper mill to pass in different values of your parameters
    to the notebook and then automatically execute the whole notebook and spit out
    kind of a final。Completed， executed Jupyter notebook on the output side of things。![](img/fada9b10c7f63ddff8bee1e0b3c83e54_9.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Or thinking about it with in B format， you could dynamically create a certain
    type of notebook with In B format using Python。 you could then execute that notebook
    using paperm。 and then maybe you could convert that notebook into a PDFf。 and，
    you know。 maybe automatically email it out or something like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this is kind of a way that these extensions are very powerful and can be
    used in conjunction with one another。![](img/fada9b10c7f63ddff8bee1e0b3c83e54_11.png)

- en: Now， the very last thing I want to leave you with。Is just if you Google Jupiter
    notebook extensions。And then come to this i Python contri Jupiter contri in B
    extensions。And let's see specifically。 here is a link to the documentation。![](img/fada9b10c7f63ddff8bee1e0b3c83e54_16.png)

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So any kind of functionality that you want with in Jupyter notebooks might exist
    with a Jupyter notebook extension。 So there are all kinds of things that you can
    do here from let's see。 code font size to automatically liing your code。To let's
    see here， do do do do。You've got all kinds of different extensions in here。 you
    have a spell checker。You have this， oh。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the hinter land one， which gives you code hints or autocompte for your code，
    all kinds of， oh yeah。 code folding here。All kinds of different extensions for
    Jupiter notebooks that you can check out here。 so if you want certain functionality，
    it might exist here。
