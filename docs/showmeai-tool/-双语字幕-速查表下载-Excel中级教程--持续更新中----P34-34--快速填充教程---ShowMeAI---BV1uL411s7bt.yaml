- en: In this tutorialÔºå I'm going to show you a great feature that's in the latest
    versions of Excel„ÄÇ And it's called flash fill„ÄÇ And in a lot of cases„ÄÇ this will
    be a great time saver for you in order to show you how flash fill works„ÄÇ I've
    created a sample spreadsheet„ÄÇ and it's basically a list of 100 names„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here to the right of the namesÔºå I have a column for first nameÔºå last name„ÄÇ
    first initial and last initial„ÄÇ So let's say that I've been given the task of
    taking this spreadsheet full of people's names and separating out the first name„ÄÇ
    and the last nameÔºå and then also putting in the initials„ÄÇ This could be a huge
    nightmare„ÄÇ a huge headache„ÄÇ especially if instead of 100 names I had 1000 names
    to do or 10000 or more„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: in a previous videoÔºå I showed you how to split names„ÄÇ And you should still watch
    that video if you're interested in learning how to do that„ÄÇ But today„ÄÇ I want
    to show you how to accomplish this task that I have to do using the flash fill
    option that„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇIn the more recent versions of Excel the first thing I need to do
    is show Excel what kind of information I want So I'm gonna click here where it
    says first name and there in cell H2 in this case„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going click and type in Stephanie and then I'll hit return or enter on the
    keyboard and next all I have to do is go to the data tab and look for the data
    tools group you'll find flash fill So I click on flash fill and look what it did
    it figured out based on the data that I had already typed into column H„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it figured out that I wanted just the first name„ÄÇ and it's not based on the
    column title that I typed here„ÄÇ No it's actually based on the fact that I typed
    in Stephanie the first name here„ÄÇ Excel figured that out and applied it all the
    way down the entire column Now notice whenever you do flash fill you'll get a
    few comments here in the lower left corner So pay attention to this lower left
    corner when you use flash fill It says flash fill change„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: CellsÔºå and it says 149„ÄÇ So 149 cells were affected by this flash fill that I
    just did„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ let's try it now with last names„ÄÇ So here in the last name columnÔºå
    I'm just going type in grambling„ÄÇ And this timeÔºå notice if I go up to dataÔºå I
    can't do flash fill„ÄÇ The reason why is because this cell that I'm typing in is
    still active„ÄÇ And so technically„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's really nothing in that cell at all until I tap return or enter„ÄÇ Now
    there's something there in the cell„ÄÇ and there's data in the column„ÄÇ So now I
    can go up to data and choose flash fill„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ I don't want you to get the impression
    that you always have to have selected the cell below the information that you
    want to mimic„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: NoÔºå you don't„ÄÇ I could be down here„ÄÇ I could be back on that data but you do
    have to make sure that the data that you're going be mimicking has actually been
    entered into the cell and it's not just in progress of being entered into the
    cell„ÄÇ So to prove that I'm just going to go up here to grambling„ÄÇClick on it to
    select it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll click flash fill and look it worked perfectly all the way down„ÄÇ I can check„ÄÇ
    let's say number 89 Delmer quail„ÄÇ AllrightÔºå it worked perfectly„ÄÇ I'm going go
    back up now„ÄÇ let's try it just with first initial So S and this time I'm gonna
    just click here a few cells down just to prove to you that you can select any
    cell in the column that you want to flash fill to„ÄÇ Also this time instead of clicking
    on flash fillÔºå I want to use the keyboard shortcut„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's control E„ÄÇ So you just hold control and tap E„ÄÇ and it does the same thing
    as if you had clicked the flash fill button„ÄÇ So take a look at that it worked
    perfectly I have the first initial of the first name Now let's try last initial
    and I'm gonna base it off of a different person instead of basing it off of Stephanie
    graling I'd like to base it off of Alberttha Kenny so I'm gonna click here I'll
    put in her last initial I'll make sure that that data is entered just by hitting
    enter a return or you could even just click away from it like I did„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But I am in the column that I want to flash fill into„ÄÇ and then I'll hold control
    Tap E„ÄÇ And let's check to see if it worked„ÄÇ It did„ÄÇ So even though there are other
    ways to do some of this„ÄÇ for exampleÔºå using text to columnsÔºå I really love flash
    fill and I tend to use it quite a bit„ÄÇ But one word of caution„ÄÇ when you use flash
    fillÔºå you should use it pretty much only when the data that you're going be basing
    it off of is pretty stable„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's gonna to stay pretty much the same„ÄÇ And the reason I say that is this watch
    if I change Lucll Suman's name„ÄÇ let's say she changes her last name to Thompson„ÄÇ
    I tap return„ÄÇ notice that it did not update the information that was flash filled„ÄÇ
    And even if I select a part of the spreadsheet and let's say I clear it outÔºå clear
    contents„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's see what happens if I try flash fill again„ÄÇ I got some interesting results
    there„ÄÇ You see that„ÄÇ And so it really works bestÔºå flash fill does„ÄÇ if you're basing
    the„ÄÇFlash fill on data that is very stable„ÄÇ It's just gonna stay the same and
    not change„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ I want to show one last example„ÄÇ let's say instead of initials
    or first name last name„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: What if I just want to change the name so that they start with the last name
    and then go comma and then first name„ÄÇ that should work as well„ÄÇ So I'm going
    to try that outÔºå I'm just going go to this cell here„ÄÇ type in grambling comm Stephanie
    I'll tap enter or return„ÄÇ and then I'll hold control tap E and it followed the
    pattern„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now I want you to know that even though my examples I'll have to do with names„ÄÇ
    Flash fill works with lots of other things as well„ÄÇ all it's doing is it's looking
    for a pattern„ÄÇ In this caseÔºå it saw that there were two words„ÄÇ and then it saw
    that I only typed the first word here„ÄÇ So then when I flash filledÔºå it just saw
    that pattern and it copied it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now if it doesn't follow the pattern perfectlyÔºå you may need to type two examples
    into the column and then try flash fill and then it will be much more likely to
    see the pattern„ÄÇ but„ÄÇMy point is that this works with much more than just names„ÄÇ
    If there's any pattern at all„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it will try to see that pattern„ÄÇ understandstand it and then mimic it„ÄÇ SoÔºå for
    example„ÄÇ let's say you have a list of phone numbers and you want to put in the
    dashes for the phone numbers„ÄÇ You can do that„ÄÇ Just go ahead and type it the way
    you want it to look„ÄÇ and then tap enter or return„ÄÇ NowÔºå before I actually do the
    flash fill„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I need to have other phone numbers listed„ÄÇ So give me a minute to add a few
    phone numbers„ÄÇ and then I'll show you the results„ÄÇ OkayÔºå great„ÄÇ So now if I do
    flash fill„ÄÇ look what it does„ÄÇ It put in the dashes in this case„ÄÇ And now that
    I've done that„ÄÇ I don't really need this column n anymore more„ÄÇ So I could right
    click on itÔºå delete„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and there's my data formatted the way I want it to be„ÄÇ So that should get you
    started using flash fill in your Excel spreadsheets„ÄÇ I hope that you found this
