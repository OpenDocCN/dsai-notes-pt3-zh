- en: In this tutorial， I will show you an easy way to create data entry forms in
    Excel。 and these forms make it so much easier to enter records or data into Excel。
    You can see here on the screen。 I have a pretty simple spreadsheet。 This is an
    employee list with names， higher dates， employee numbers and departments。

- en: Let's say that a business has decided that they want to have an employee sheet。
    and this is just the beginning of setting up that employee list。 Now。 imagine
    how time consuming and painful it would be to enter all of this data for let's
    say 200 employees。 Yes， you can do it。 you can just click on the appropriate sale。
    you can type tab over type。

- en: But doing it this way can lead to more mistakes。 And so let's look at how to
    set up an easy data entry form in Excel。 The first step that I'm gonna to have
    to take is to go up here to the quick access bar。 This is a handybar where you
    can add additional tools and features that you want to be able。access easily and
    quickly。 That's why it's called the quick access toolbar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And if you haven't already watched my previous tutorial on how to customize
    the quick access toolbar。 please do so。 But for the purposes of this video I'm
    just gonna click here on this button this is the customized quick access toolbar
    button When you click that it gives you a list of some of the items that you can
    add to the quick access toolbar or take off the quick access toolbar but if you
    look toward the bottom of this popup menu。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's an option for more commands。 and I'm gonna to click that it takes me
    to a list of popular Excel commands。 but in this case， what we're looking for
    is not necessarily popular So I'm going go down to either all commands or commands
    not in ribbon I'll just pick commands not in ribbon and what I'm looking for is
    form。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's what I'm trying to create a quick easy data entry form So I'm gonna browse
    down look for form there it is I click on it and if you'll notice here on the
    right side there are some items already。In this list， compareare those to what's
    up above here on my quick access toolbar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's the same things。 The same features are listed here as are here on the upper
    left。 So I want to add form to that list。 Having selected form， I just click add。
    it's now added to this list。 And when I click on okay。 it will now be added to
    my quick access toolbar。 So there it is now that I have that button readily accessible
    to me。
  prefs: []

- en: I will be able to easily create a data entry form for my Excel spreadsheet。
    All right。 the next thing we need to do is take this data that I have here in
    my spreadsheet and turn it into a table。 For some reason， that's a prerequisite
    of using these quick forms。 So how to turn this into a table。 All I have to do
    is click somewhere inside the data How about here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then here on the home tab home ribbon in the styles group。 there's a button
    that says format as table。 Now， there is a faster way to do it。 Once you've clicked
    anywhere in the data。 you can just。The control key and tap T for table and that
    will bring up this pop up and here Excel has tried to guess what my data consists
    of and in 99% of the cases it does it correctly you'll notice that there's a dashed
    line that's kind of moving across the top here and on the left and on the right
    that is outlining the shape of the table and in most cases it gets it perfectly
    correct If not you may need to change some of the numbers here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you may need to click this and then outline what you want to be included or
    you might need to check or uncheck my table has headers I'm just gonna to click
    OK let's see if it works。 it looks like it did I can tell that Excel has identified
    these items here as headers so I think that worked just fine and now let's move
    on to the next step At this point I just want to have clicked somewhere in the
    table so I'll just make sure that I've done that I click and now I go up here
    to the quick access toolbar and click the form button。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， notice what it did。 It has identified 22 records or rows in this table。
    It doesn't count the header row。 It just skips it。 but you'll notice that record
    number one is Gina pullen here at the left。 But all of the data and information
    related to Gina Puen is listed vertically in this case instead of horizontally。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， there are a couple of reasons why this is helpful。 One of them is。 let's
    say you have a spreadsheet with like 14 columns or 15 columns。 you wouldn't want
    to have to click this bar and drag to the right and type in the data or to tab
    over up to 14 times in order to enter in your data。 It's kind of cumbersome to
    do it that way。 And so that's why you might want to do what I'm showing here by
    creating an easy data entry form。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， if I click find next。 Look what it does。 It goes to the next record， Marcelinina
    Restrpo。 click find next again。 Regia Loftus and so forth。 And it's numbering
    those records here at the。T right so I can click through those Now let's say it's
    time to resume entering data for the employees of this company。 I can click new。
    notice it says new record。 I just click and next name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll type the next employee's name if I tap tab it does move to the next data
    entry cell higher date Now you can just type that in the way you typically would
    maybe with the day than the month in the year or you can hold the control key
    and tap semicolon and that puts today's date into the form In this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Gary Larson was not hired today so I will go ahead and change that to a different
    date put in the employee number and I can either click to the next cell in this
    entry form or I can tab just like I did before put in the department and at this
    point I can tap enter on the keyboard it inserts the record into my spreadsheet
    and gives me a new blank form if I close and browse down the page you can see
    there's Gary Larson higher date employee number and。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Department jumping back into the form is super easy。 I just go up here on the
    quick access toolbar。 click form。 I'm right back in there。 I want to enter a new
    employee， and I simply resume。 So if you do a lot of data entry， you're gonna
    to find yourself really preferring these easy data entry forms that you can create
    and use in Excel。 and it's really easy to do。 while we're here in this form tool。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I want to point out some of the other features and buttons that we have。 So
    we've looked already at new。 notice that there's also delete。 So this is a mistake。
    Obviously。 I don't know how I made that one。 but I can just click delete displayed
    record will be permanently deleted。 That's exactly what I want。 So I click okay。
    and it's gone。 We also have a find previous button。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that goes from number 25 to number 24 to record number 23， etc ce。 You can
    also find next。 that advances to higher numbers。 and then we have a criteria button
    and a restore button。 let's look at the restore button。 So I'm gonna click。Find
    previous a few times here we have a person named Eileen Osterberg and let's say
    that the company is considering changing her department from sales to customer
    service。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so I can just type that in。 but what if I realize that that was a mistake I
    can just click restorestore and it goes right back to the way it was before I
    started changing the data in this form。 So as long as you don't click close or
    tap enter on the keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: everything that you type here is easy to undo just by clicking the restorestore
    button。 one button left to look at besides close and that is criteria。 the way
    criteria works is you click it and then you enter criteria into this form and
    then Excel will see if it can find one or more of the records here in the spreadsheet
    that match the criteria。 So for example， I would really like to find someone who
    has a name that includes the word Bob and the higher date doesn't really matter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the employee number doesn't really matter。The department should be communications。
    All right。 so I have bo and communications。 At this point， all I have to do is
    tap enter on the keyboard and look。 it found Bob in communications。 There he is。
    Now you may at first think that this number here in the upper right indicates
    that there are 25 or 18 Bob's in communication。 but if you click next， you'll
    notice that's really all there is just one bob in communications。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So what if I want to see everyone in communications。 not just Bob to do that。
    I'm gonna to close the form。 open it back up and go to criteria。 put in communications。
    tap enter on the keyboard。 and now look， it found Regia Loftus。 if I click next
    Palma Newmeister。 and there is good old Bob again。 So I hope that you see how
    useful an Excel data entry form can be。

- en: It can take your data entry task that might be two horizontal and it can make
    it vertical and notice that you can scroll。 so it could be 10。520 different bits
    of data that you're entering in， and it makes them vertical。 not horizontal， and
    it gives you these tools at the right to also help you to search within the table
    that you've created。
