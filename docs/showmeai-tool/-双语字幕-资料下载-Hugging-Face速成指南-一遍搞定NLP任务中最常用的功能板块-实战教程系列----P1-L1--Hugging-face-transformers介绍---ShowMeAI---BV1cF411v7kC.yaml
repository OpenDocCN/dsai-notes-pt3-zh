- en: Hi， everyone。 I'm Patrick。 And in today's video， we are going to learn how to
    get started with Hagingface and the Transformers library。 The Haging F Transformers
    library is probably the most popular NLP library and Python right now and it can
    be combined directly with pytorch or Tensofflow。

- en: It provides state of the art natural language processing models and has a very
    clean API that makes it extremely simple to build powerful NLP pipelines。 So today
    we have a first look at the library and build a sentiment classification algorithm。
    I show you some basic functions。 And then we have a look at the model hub。 And
    then I also show you how you can fine tune in your own model。 So let's get started。
    Allright。
