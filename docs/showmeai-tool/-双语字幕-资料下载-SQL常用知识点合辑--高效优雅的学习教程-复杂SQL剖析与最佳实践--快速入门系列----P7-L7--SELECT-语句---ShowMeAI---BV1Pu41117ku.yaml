- en: 哦。In this tutorial I'm going to show you how to retrieve data from a single
    table Now look at the navigator panel Currently none of our databases is displayed
    in bulk that means none of these databases is selected for querying so the first
    step to write a query to get data from a database is to select a database the
    query that will write will be executed against that database。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this demo， we're going to use this SQL stored database， so we type out use
    SQL online store。Now use is a keyword in the SQL language， and that's the reason
    it's displayed in blue。Now SQL is not a case sensitive language， and that means
    we can use uppercase or lowercase characters。 it doesn't really matter， but as
    a best practice， we should capitalize the SQL keywords and use lowercase characters
    for anything else。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So now let's go ahead and execute this query。Allright， look。 this SQL store
    database is now displayed in Bult。Now， in my skill workbe。 you can also select
    a database by double clicking that。 So now I double click SQL invoicing and it's
    the current database。 Now， if we run this query again。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，The SQL store database becomes selected。All right。 now let's write our first
    query to retrieve all the customers in this database。😊。So after the use statement
    we're going to use the select statement here's the basic syntax or basic structure
    of the select statement we type out select in front of that we specify the columns
    that we want to retrieve。 for example， we can retrieve the customer ID column
    as well as the first name column or we can retrieve all columns using an asterisk。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now after that I've used the F clause， and this is where we specify the table
    that we want to query in this case。 the customers table， So this is the simplest
    query to select all the customers in a given table。😊。Now whenever you have multiple
    SQL statements， you need to terminate each statement using a semicolon。 so look
    we have a red underline here that indicates an arrow。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if you hover your mouse here you can see this tool tube saying select is not
    valid at this position because we didn't terminate the first statement with a
    semicolon now let's execute this query one more time once again we can click on
    this button here or we can use a shortcut。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So look at the query menu on the top。😊，The first item is execute。Now here's
    the shortcut for this command on Mac， it's shift command and enter on Windows
    is' going to be different。Honestly， I'm not sure。 So whatever it is， use that。
    So I'm going to press shift command and enter。😊。And here are all the customers
    and a table。So this select statement has two clauses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the select clause and the f clause， but there are other clauses that we can
    use to filter and sort data。 for example， we can use the where clauses。To filter
    the result and get the customer with ID1 so we can write an expression like this
    where customer underline ID equals one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， when we execute this query， we'll only get the customer with I1。😊，So this
    is the where clause。 we can also sort the data so。😊，After where we use the order
    by clause。 And here we specify the columns that we want to sort the result on。
    Let's say we want to sort these customers by their first name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we type out first on the line name。 that is the name of one of the columns
    in this table。 right Now if we execute this query， this order by doesn't really
    have any impact because we only get one record in the result。 So let me temporarily
    take out the where clause So do that。 we can put two hyphens in front of this
    line。 Now this line is treated as a comment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: which means the SQL engine is not going to execute this。 Okay。 so let's execute
    this query one more time。😊，Now all the customers that we get are sorted based
    on their first name。So that's the basic idea。Now over the next few tutorials。
    you're going to learn more about each of these clauses in detail。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but what you need to take away in this tutorial is that these three clauses
    from where an order by are optional as you can see in this example I'm not using
    the word clause。 we can also comment out the order by clause， we can also comment
    out the from clause so instead of selecting all the columns in a given table we
    can select some values like one and two Now if you execute this query one more
    time in the result we get something like this two columns called one and2 and
    in this columns we have these values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So all these clauses are optional， but in the real world we quite often use
    all of them。 Now what you need to understand here is that the order of these clauses
    matters。 So we always have select first then we have from then where and finally
    order by we cannot change the order of these clauses。 otherwise we get a syntax
    error which basically means the syntax or the grammar or the structure of our
    SQL statement is incorrect so it can't be executed and one last thing before we
    finish this tutorial In this example you can see I've listed all these clauses
    on a new line that technically you don't have to do this because line breaks。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: white spaces and tabs are ignored when executing SQL statements So we could
    come back here and put from in front of select So select star from customers all
    in one line and that perfectly fine for simple queries but as your queries get
    more complex it's better to put each clause on a new line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，So that's all for this tutorial， and the next tutorial will'll explore the
    set clause in detail。😊。![](img/3ac0cd0bdd7339c70521bd045805fd1d_2.png)
