- en: In this short Excel tutorial， I want to show you how you can quickly and fairly
    easily set up Excel so that it always opens up the same files every time you turn
    it on So here I have three different spreadsheets。 And let's say for some reason，
    I need all three open on a regular basis。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of having to open each one one at a time。 I can simply go to the desktop。
    So I'm going to minimize the three Excel files。 And then all you have to do is
    create a folder like I've done here。 to create your own folder， you can just right
    click on the desktop。 but this folder doesn't have to be on the desktop。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It could be in your file Expr anywhere on your computer。 But anyway， right click
    new folder。 give it a name。 and then simply put Excel files in that folder。 Now。
    these should only be Excel files that you want to open every time you open Excel。
    So be picky about what you put in there。 Now， if you really don't want to move
    files maybe。

- en: They're shared files， if you move them， it'll make it hard for other people
    to access those same files In that case。 look at what you can do。 you can right
    click on the file that you don't want to physically move into a folder and just
    select create shortcut once you have the shortcut click and drag and put the shortcut
    in the folder so just to quickly review we've created a folder and put Excel files
    or shortcuts to Excel files into that folder and that's what I did earlier with
    this very important project smorrgs board3 very important Excel files are in that
    folder now that that's done。

- en: I can open up Excel and it doesn't really matter what Excel spreadsheet I'm
    in。 I could even just be in a completely blank Excel spreadsheet but the trick
    is to go here to file and then go down to options and it brings up some basic
    general options but if you go into advanced and browse down almost all the way
    to the bottom you should see an option here where。

- en: says at start， open all files in and here you have to put in the file location
    for that folder。 So here is my file location for my folder。 Yours will probably
    be similar。 but that's the hard drive that's one of the folders another subfolder
    subfolder and for me it's desktop。 but for you it might not be。 It might be your
    documents folder or anywhere else on your computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then the final thing listed there is the folder that has your Excel documents
    or shortcuts to those Excel documents that you want to open up every time Excel
    opens。 Once you've got that in。 just click okay Now I'll close out of all of my
    Excel spreadsheets。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Excel is completely closed and now I'll open it up again and see what happens。
    Look all three important spreadsheets opened up and are ready to be used So this
    is a great time saver。 If you use Excel a lot。 Sure， maybe it just saves you5
    seconds a day。 but if you use Excel every single day。This is gonna add up and
    this trick will save you some time and some hassle。

- en: If you change your mind about the files that you would like to automatically
    open， you can。 of course， just change what you have inside the folder So I could
    move these out of the folder。 or if these are just shortcuts like this one。 you
    don't even have to move it out of the folder just right click on it and delete
    it。 You're just deleting a shortcut， you're not deleting the actual file and that
    will change which files automatically open when you start up Excel。

- en: If you want to add additional Excel spreadsheets or files you can just click
    and drag and drop them into the folder and you'll be good to go Now。 what if you
    decide you don't want any files to automatically open that's okay。 you can just
    go here to file options go back to advanced down to the bottom of the list of
    options and then select the file location that's in the system delete it and click
    Now when I open up Excel。 it does not。
