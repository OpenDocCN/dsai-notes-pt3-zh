In this tutorial， I'm going to show you a great feature that's in the latest versions of Excel。 And it's called flash fill。 And in a lot of cases。 this will be a great time saver for you in order to show you how flash fill works。 I've created a sample spreadsheet。 and it's basically a list of 100 names。

 And here to the right of the names， I have a column for first name， last name。 first initial and last initial。 So let's say that I've been given the task of taking this spreadsheet full of people's names and separating out the first name。 and the last name， and then also putting in the initials。 This could be a huge nightmare。 a huge headache。 especially if instead of 100 names I had 1000 names to do or 10000 or more。 Now。

 in a previous video， I showed you how to split names。 And you should still watch that video if you're interested in learning how to do that。 But today。 I want to show you how to accomplish this task that I have to do using the flash fill option that。😊。In the more recent versions of Excel the first thing I need to do is show Excel what kind of information I want So I'm gonna click here where it says first name and there in cell H2 in this case。

 I'm going to click and type in Stephanie and then I'll hit return or enter on the keyboard and next all I have to do is go to the data tab and look for the data tools group you'll find flash fill So I click on flash fill and look what it did it figured out based on the data that I had already typed into column H。

 it figured out that I wanted just the first name。 and it's not based on the column title that I typed here。 No it's actually based on the fact that I typed in Stephanie the first name here Excel figured that out and applied it all the way down the entire column Now notice whenever you do flash fill you'll get a few comments here in the lower left corner So pay attention to this lower left corner when you use flash fill It says flashlash fill change。

Cells， and it says 149。 So 149 cells were affected by this flash fill that I just did。 Okay。 let's try it now with last names。 So here in the last name column， I'm just going type in grambling。 And this time， notice if I go up to data， I can't do flash fill。 The reason why is because this cell that I'm typing in is still active。 And so technically。

 there's really nothing in that cell at all until I tap， return or enter。 Now there's something there in the cell。 and there's data in the column。 So now I can go up to data and choose flash fill。 Now。 I don't want you to get the impression that you always have to have selected the cell below the information that you want to mimic。

 No， you don't。 I could be down here。 I could be back on that data but you do have to make sure that the data that you're going be mimicking has actually been entered into the cell。 and it's not just in progress of being entered into the cell。 So to prove that I'm just going to go up here to grambling。Click on it to select it。 I'll click flash fill and look it worked perfectly all the way down。 I can check。

 let's say number 89 Delmer quail。 Allright， it worked perfectly。 I'm going go back up now。 let's try it just with first initial So S and this time I'm going just click here a few cells down just to prove to you that you can select any cell in the column that you want to flash fill to。

 Also this time instead of clicking on flash fill， I want to use the keyboard shortcut。 It's control E。 So you just hold control and tap E and it does the same thing as if you had clicked the flash fill button。 So take a look at that it worked perfectly I have the first initial of the first name Now let's try last initial and I'm gonna base it off of a different person instead of basing it off of Stephanie graling I'd like to base it off of Alberttha Kenny so I'm gonna click here I'll put in her last initial I'll make sure that that data is entered just by hitting enter a return or you could even just click away from it like I did。

But I am in the column that I want to flash fill into。 and then I'll hold control。 Tap E。 And let's check to see if it worked。 It did。 So even though there are other ways to do some of this。 for example， using text to columns， I really love flash fill and I tend to use it quite a bit。 But one word of caution。 when you use flash fill， you should use it pretty much only when the data that you're going be basing it off of is pretty stable。

 it's gonna to stay pretty much the same。 And the reason I say that is this。 watch if I change Lucll Suman's name， let's say she changes her last name to Thompson， I tap return。 notice that it did not update the information that was flash filled。 And even if I select a part of the spreadsheet and let's say I clear it out， clear contents。

 let's see what happens if I try flash fill again， I got some interesting results there。 you see that。 And so it really works best， flash fill does。 if you're basing the。Flash fill on data that is very stable。 It's just gonna stay the same and not change。 Okay。 I want to show one last example。 Let's say instead of initials or first name last name。

 What if I just want to change the name so that they start with the last name and then go comma and then first name。 that should work as well。 So I'm going to try that out， I'm just going go to this cell here。 type in grambling comm Stephanie， I'll tap enter or return。 and then I'll hold control tap E and it followed the pattern。

 Now I want you to know that even though my examples I'll have to do with names。 Flash fill works with lots of other things as well。 all it's doing is it's looking for a pattern。 In this case， it saw that there were two words， and then it saw that I only typed the first word here。 So then when I flash filled， it just saw that pattern and it copied it。

 Now if it doesn't follow the pattern perfectly， you may need to type two examples into the column and then try flash fill and then it will be much more likely to see the pattern。 but。My point is that this works with much more than just names。 If there's any pattern at all。

 it will try to see that pattern， understandstand it and then mimic it。 So， for example。 let's say you have a list of phone numbers and you want to put in the dashes for the phone numbers。 you can do that， just go ahead and type it the way you want it to look。 and then tap enter or return。 Now， before I actually do the flash fill。

 I need to have other phone numbers listed。 So give me a minute to add a few phone numbers。 and then I'll show you the results。 Okay， great。 So now if I do flash fill。 look what it does。 It put in the dashes in this case。 And now that I've done that。 I don't really need this column n anymore more。 So I could right click on it。

 delete and there's my data formatted the way I want it to be。![](img/52065da7554d0cf7a1eff923218061cf_2.png)
