    use to quickly and easily generate beautiful visuals for your spreadsheets and

- en: So here I have an Excel workbook with a family income spreadsheet for a hypothetical
    family and I have a 2020 spreadsheet with a lot of financial data and of course
    I could generate some visuals。 some charts， etc cetera by selecting the data itself
    and going to insert and inserting charts of various kinds and I can also use this
    tool here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the quick analysis button to investigate some visuals that I can add。 And if
    you want to learn more about both of those methods。 please see my other videos
    but in this video I want to focus on Excel ideas。 If you want to use Excel ideas。![](img/f62ec9b8410ed5ac0d09dc6769c7b3d2_2.png)

- en: You don't even have to select the data All you do is open up a spreadsheet and
    then click on the Home tab Home ribbon at the right side you should have ideas
    again if you have Office 365 click the button you may need to be patient so wait
    a little bit and it will bring up a list of ideas of visuals that you could add
    to your spreadsheet It's suggesting a pie chart about income sources it's also
    suggesting a pivot table that I might like income sources。

- en: an interesting looking pivot chart and notice that there are a total of six
    results so there are some results that are hidden I could click show all results
    like I just did and then browse down to see the remaining options So I like this
    first pie chart I'll click insert chart and it adds it to the spreadsheet just
    off to the right and below the data in this case if I zoom out a bit you can see
    a little bit better where it put that pie chart in my case。
  prefs: []

- en: I also want the pivot table， so I'll click insertt pivot table in this case。
    because it is a pivot table， it didn't add it to the spreadsheet itself。 but rather
    it created a new spreadsheet in the workbook and it's a pivot table about the
    data in my family income spreadsheet。 Of course I could reorder the spreadsheets
    by clicking and dragging to place idea1 next to the spreadsheet where the idea
    came from。

- en: Now， of course， once you've added these ideas whether they be charts， pivot
    tables。 pivot charts etc ce， they are editable so I could click to adjust this
    pie chart for example。 and I could use the tools that are here to change the chart
    style to do some chart filters and I can click to add chart elements and so much
    more for example selecting the chart there are some chart design options here
    at the top and format options。 So these ideas they're premade predetermined using
    artificial intelligence， but I love。

    Let's now try Excel ideas again。 but with a much more complicated spreadsheet。
    I'm going to close the ideas panel， and as you can see， I'm now on the spreadsheet
    titled 2020。 This is a huge spreadsheet with lots of data。 So fortunately。

- en: I don't have to select the data to use Excel ideas just beyond the spreadsheet，
    home tab。 home ribbon， click ideas。 And it generates a list of ideas。 You can
    see。 the ideas generated in this case are quite different。 And the reason why
    is because the data is very different from that previous spreadsheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: In this case， I get a total of 36 idea results。 So many。 many more to choose
    from Some very interesting powerful looking charts。 This one talks about outliers。
    This one found a correlation between two different pieces of information。 This
    pivot chart highlights a pattern in the data。 So this can。
