    area of plots and basically a pair plot is going to plot the relationships across
    the entire data frames numerical values so let's create one we can say pair plot
    and。Cash data frame and look at all that information so tons of information and
    you can see here on the left side we have our totals。

- en: we have speeding data we're also going to have data on alcohol and we're going
    to be comparing these columns and rows and how all of these different pieces of
    data are all going to play into each other in regards to generating these both
    on the diagonal histograms and then scatter plots everywhere else。

- en: but there are tons of things we can change here let's go and load another piece
    of data。 let's say we want to get our tips data frame and again you're going to
    load this new data with load。![](img/4a9e49a89e73c905344cc66b813032a6_1.png)

- en: Data set and tips and。Just to show you what is in the tips data frame that we
    have here。 Basically we're gonna to have our total bill， the tip amounts who tips
    $1。1 I don't know there is whether it's male or female。 whether they smoke or
    not the day in which this purchase was made and whether it was dinner or lunch
    and the size of the party I believe that is what that is referring to So just
    to work with some different data and mix things up here let's create another plot
    here So let's get rid of this and I'm going say SNS dot pair plot and we're going
    to be using the tips data frame and with you you can pass in categorical data
    and the charts will be colorized based off of that categorical data So let's say
    we want to get data this time in regards to the sex。

    forth very soon。 but this is a matplot lib palette called blues that I've used
    in previous tutorials and you can see here now everything's using the blue styling
    and you can also see that the light color dots are for male and the dark colors
    are for female and you can see the plots that we're able to make there and basically
    it's total be tip and size and total bill tip and size is the information that
    we're pulling up here and I'll just talk about styling here in a second so we
    can change these font sizes and so forth and whenever we get into grids I'm going
    show you how to make these plots and then put different graphs on the top and
    down the diagonal and on the bottom of our grid of plots but now I want to talk
    about rug。
