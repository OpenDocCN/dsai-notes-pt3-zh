- en: In this Excel tutorialÔºå we're going to look at how to take data from Excel and
    insert it into Microsoft Word„ÄÇ Let's say I just want to copy this data here and
    paste it into Microsoft Word„ÄÇ Is that going to workÔºå Let's try it out„ÄÇ If I click
    and drag with the mouse and select the data I want to copy„ÄÇ I can then use a control
    C keyboard shortcut to copy that range„ÄÇ And then in Microsoft Word„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can hold control and tap V for paste„ÄÇ And the data paste it in pretty well„ÄÇ
    And as you can see„ÄÇ the data is editable„ÄÇ I can change this amount„ÄÇ Let's see
    what that does„ÄÇ It did change the amount„ÄÇ but the total did not adjust„ÄÇ And so
    it's treating this basically as simply text„ÄÇ Let's see if there's a better way
    to insert the data into Microsoft Word„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We could try converting this range into a table by clicking insert and clicking
    on tables and just choosing a regular table„ÄÇClick O„ÄÇ It's now turned this into
    a table„ÄÇ NowÔºå if I click and drag to select the data„ÄÇ copy it and go into word
    and paste„ÄÇ the results seem to be a little better„ÄÇ But even so„ÄÇ if I change numbers„ÄÇ
    LookÔºå changing that number did not update the total below„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there's got to be a better way„ÄÇ In my opinionÔºå the best method for inserting
    this data into word is to first copy the range and then go into Microsoft word„ÄÇ
    and instead of simply pastingÔºå go up here to the home tab in the clipboard group„ÄÇ
    if you click on the paste buttonÔºå but the bottom half of the paste button„ÄÇ it
    brings up some options„ÄÇ And one of them is paste special„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that gives me all sorts of special ways that I can paste this data„ÄÇ But
    the one at the very top is the1 I'm looking for„ÄÇ Microsoft Excel worksheet object„ÄÇ
    I select it„ÄÇ click OÔºå and it's gonna paste my data in as an Excel object„ÄÇ Now
    you can see my chart here off to the rightÔºå but that's okay„ÄÇNowÔºå this time„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because I've inserted this data as an Excel object„ÄÇ let's look at how it behaves„ÄÇ
    Can I change the numbersÔºå YesÔºå I can„ÄÇ If I double click on itÔºå I'm still in Microsoft
    Word„ÄÇ but I'm seeing some of the Microsoft Excel options„ÄÇ And let's say I get
    as„ÄÇ I tap enter on the keyboardÔºå and it adjusts the total„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's treating this like what it is an Excel object„ÄÇ Also„ÄÇ notice I can access
    Excel filters and change some of those to filter out some of the data„ÄÇ And so
    in many waysÔºå this is Excel from within Microsoft Word„ÄÇ You can even see the green
    Excel color scheme appearing here at the top„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: even though I am in Microsoft Word„ÄÇ When I'm ready to continue composing my
    word document„ÄÇ I can just click away from the Excel object„ÄÇ and now it's clear
    that I'm back in Microsoft Word„ÄÇ But my changes are still in effect„ÄÇ So this is
    great„ÄÇ but it's important for you to know that this is a link and embed„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So the data in this word document is linked to my Microsoft Excel document„ÄÇ
    Now let's look at the chart„ÄÇ Is it possible for me to copy paste this chart into
    Microsoft Word Well„ÄÇ I'll start by selecting it and using the control C keyboard
    shortcut„ÄÇ and then in Microsoft word I'm gonna tap enter a couple of times to
    move my cursor down the page a little bit„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I'm going go here to paste and I'll click at the bottom half just like I
    did before„ÄÇ go to paste special and I'll paste this as a Microsoft Excel chart
    object„ÄÇ I click and there's my chart„ÄÇ It came in a little big„ÄÇ so I can click
    and drag on the corner to shrink that down a bit I can also click on the side
    here and squeeze it that way as well„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and with my pie chart selected notice what it says double click to edit Microsoft
    Excel worksheet„ÄÇ So if I double click that similar to what I showed above it basically
    tries to open up Excel from within word and I can make some„ÄÇI can then double
    click just like I can from within Excel to select a portion of the pie chart„ÄÇ
    and then I can click and drag to explode it out„ÄÇ I can right click on a slice
    of the pie or on the chart itself to make some changes just like I can from within
    Excel„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this can be a great method for bringing your Excel content into word„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
    there are cases when you wouldn't want the data or the chart to be editable like
    they are in this case„ÄÇ What if I'm gonna be sending this word document to someone
    else„ÄÇ and I don't want them to be able to edit the Excel data or the pie chart„ÄÇ
    In that case„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: from within Excel„ÄÇ What I would do is I would select the data„ÄÇ And then go here
    to the clipboard group„ÄÇ and I would choose not the main button copy but the arrow
    next to it„ÄÇ If you click the arrow„ÄÇ it says copy as picture„ÄÇ and I can choose
    to copy it as it would look when printed on paper or as it is on the screen„ÄÇ And
    the format can be either as a picture or a bitm„ÄÇ So those are good„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To play around with In my caseÔºå I'm gonna go with as shown on screen and picture„ÄÇ
    But before I do„ÄÇ I think I'll cancel that and I'll move this chart just out of
    the way a little bit and try it again„ÄÇ I'll select itÔºå go into copy as picture
    click O So now that that data is copied as a picture„ÄÇ I'll go into word on this
    new page and I will go to paste And this time I can just click on the top half
    of paste I'm just pasting this as an image„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I don't need this text to be editable„ÄÇ So now when I double click on it„ÄÇ I don't
    have the option to edit the data„ÄÇ and of course I could do the same exact thing
    with my pie chart„ÄÇ select itÔºå go to the arrow button next to copyÔºå choose copy
    as pictureÔºå click O and then in Word„ÄÇ I can do control V to paste or I can just
    go to the home tab and click the paste button„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and of course I could drag those to put them in the right order„ÄÇ So those are
    two ways to bring Excel data into your word documents„ÄÇ![](img/8772423eae323c491c259246fc223492_2.png)
