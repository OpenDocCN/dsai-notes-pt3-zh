- en: 哦。In this tutorial， you're going to learn how to insert multiple rows in one
    go for this demo。 we're going to use this shipperss table。 Let's have a quick
    look at the table definition。😊。So here we have two columns， shipper ID and name。😊，Shiper
    ID is a primary key， it's not nullable。 and it's an auto incremented column， so
    we're going to let my SQl generate values for this column easy。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，We only need to supply a value for the name column， so back to our query editor
    window。😊。We type out， insert into shippers。In parenthsesis， we specify the name
    of the columns we want to insert values into。 in this case， name followed by the
    values clause。Here we add a pair of parentheses with a value like shipper1。Now
    to insert multiple rows， all you have to do is to add a comma followed by another
    pair of parenthses。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so Shiper two， and one more time， comma， parentheses， Shiper3。😊。This is how
    you can insert multiple rows in one go。Now let's execute this statement。😊，Allright。
    and then inspect the data in the shippers table。There you go。So initially we had
    only five shippers and here are the three new shippers that we inserted。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: note that my Schula automatically generated the values for the shipper ID column，
    so we have 6。7 and 8。😊，嗯。All right， here's your exercise for this tutorial。 write
    a statement to insert three rows in the products table that's pretty easy。 you
    can knock it out in a minute。😊，So here's our products table， we only have four
    columns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we're going to leave out the first column because it's an auto incremented column。
    so we only have to supply values for name， quantity and unit price。😊。Back to our
    query editor window。😊，Let's insert into product。The columns are name。Quantity
    in stock and unit price。And the values are going to be， let's say product1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Stock is going to be 10 and the unit price is going to be 1。95。 Now。 I'm going
    to select these values， copy。Come on。Paste it。Like this。Change the values accordingly。And
    finally， the last row product3。There you go， let's execute this statement。😊，All
    right。And then verify the result。 So in the products table。 Now we should have
    three new records。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the ideas you see here are 15，16 and 17， because before recording this video
    I actually inserted a few records in this table and then deleted them。 So I had
    product I 111213 and 14。 Now even though they're actually deleted from this table。
    my skill remembers their ideas。 So instead of incrementing 10 by 11， it incremented
    14。 which was the last record from before。 and that's why it generated 15。 on
    your computer。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the ideas are going to be 1112 and 13。😊，Oh。![](img/2cd7cd85a2ac13b9ae45113f35ad6b73_2.png)
