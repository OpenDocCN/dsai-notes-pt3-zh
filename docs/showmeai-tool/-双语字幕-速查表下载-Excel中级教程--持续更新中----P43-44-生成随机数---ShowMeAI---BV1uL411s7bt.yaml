- en: In this tutorial， I will show you how to quickly generate random numbers in
    Excel。 Every once in a while， you'll find yourself in a situation in Excel。 when
    you might need to have a random number。 and we're gonna look at how to generate
    two different kinds of random numbers。 The first example is a random number between0
    and1 to do this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All you have to do is click on a cell type the equal sign。 and then type in
    R。 and you can see the pop up here， it tells me what R does。 returns a random
    number greater than or equal to0 and less than one。 and notice what it says here。
    changes on recalculation。 I think you'll see what that means in just a minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So after typing equals R， all I have to do is put in a left parenthesis and
    then a right parenthesis。 There's nothing to put between the two。 Then just tap
    enter on the keyboard。 and you have a random number between 0 and1。 Now， what
    if I want a series of random numbers。 Well。 all I have to do is use the autofill
    handle。 If you're not familiar with the autofill。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Watch one of my other tutorials that teaches about the autofi handle。 but it's
    a wonderful tool that makes just this kind of thing really easy。 So I want a series
    of random numbers。 This is a random number。 all I have to do is click on the cell
    that has the random function and the formula。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that's this go to the lower right corner where there's a little green square
    put my mouse on the green square and then click and drag down。 I'll just go down
    to row number 12。 I'll release and a whole series of random numbers gets generated。
    Now you may have noticed that my first random number actually changed a little
    bit。 it gets recalculated whenever you redo it or adjust any of the random numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: look they all pretty well changed。 so now that I've got the random number。 What
    I could do is click on column B to select the entire column and then if I wanted
    to maybe I could click up here on percentages and that changes the decimals into
    a percentage79%82%。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a little bit more readable and understandable。Now what if you just want
    a random number between 5 and 5000 or between 1 and 10000。 and you want it to
    be whole numbers， not decimals Well。 in that case you use a little bit different
    function and formula In that case you type equals R between and notice what it
    says returns a random number between the numbers you specify you put in a left
    parenthesis and then the lowest number that you want it to maybe generate So1
    in this case comma and let's say 5000 is the highest number and then I put in
    the right parenthesis and tap enter on the keyboard。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: theres my random number between1 and 5000 Now notice even doing that changed
    my random numbers over here in column B now I can use the autofill handle to pull
    this down and I'll get a series of random numbers none of these are less than
    0 and none of them are more than 5000 to test this out to make sure it's really
    working I could do R between。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: esis and let's say5 comma 9。 So this will be a lot easier to see if it's really
    working。 Every number that's generated should be between 5 and 9。 and that is
    the case。 Allright。 so now that we've got these random numbers What if I want
    them to stop recalculating if I'm happy with this random set of numbers I don't
    want them to keep changing。 So what I could do is select the range of numbers
    by clicking and dragging and then I could copy that information I just did control
    C to copy and then I could click in another column just pick a cell。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'll just pick this cell here and I'll do a paste special So here and paste
    I'm just going go down to paste special and I'll choose values so it's gonna to
    paste just the values。 So now if you click on one of the numbers。 these were randomly
    generated but they were generated here in this column using the ran between function
    and you can see that here in the formula bar up here but these numbers are just
    numbers。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I copied formulas and pasted them using pastespec as values。 So these numbers
    will not change in the future， even though these clearly will you saw it change
    before your eyes just a minute ago so I could do the same thing with these numbers。
    select the range， control C to copy click here and I want to paste it but remember
    I need to do a paste special so I go here to the bottom part of the paste button
    and at the very bottom of that paste special values。 click okay and those exact
    values got pasted and of course I could change them again to percentages Now these
    numbers will continue to change because they still are random but these are set
    in stone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: They're just values。 So now with that done， if I wanted to I could just copy
    paste this column title over delete the column that's randomized because it'll
    keep changing or actually I could just copy the values and paste them on top of
    the formulas and then delete this column here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: However you want to do it， but now I have generated random numbers and these
    are stable ones they won't just keep changing。![](img/7373d6018b43ea784652d9a0d3f0a1c4_2.png)
