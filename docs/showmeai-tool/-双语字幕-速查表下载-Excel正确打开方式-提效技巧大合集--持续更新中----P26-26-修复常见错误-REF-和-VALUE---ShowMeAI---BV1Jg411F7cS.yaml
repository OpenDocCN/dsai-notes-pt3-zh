- en: This is fixing common Excel errors， part 3。 This is the third video and a threepart
    series on how to fix common Excel errors In this particular video。 we're going
    to focus on two different common errors。 One is the ref error and the other is
    the value error。 you can see the spreadsheet we're going to use this is an inventory
    with a list of supplies where they're stored and some other details about them
    like the number of packages。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the quantity per package。 and then we have a formula to calculate okay。 if there
    are 20 packages of batteries and six batteries per package， we have 120 total
    batteries。 And like I say， that's calculated automatically with this formula。
    Now， to illustrate the ref error。 let's say that I decide that you know what this
    data here is really not necessary I don't need to know the quantity per package
    I just need to know the total quantity So what if I just go in and delete columns。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and DI just clicked and dragged from C to D， It selected the entire columns，
    and I'll just delete。 You can see what happened。 I got a ref error， and the reason
    for the ref error is the formula referred to cells that no longer exist in this
    formula。 Those cells are completely gone。 I deleted the entire columns， those
    cells are gone。I'm gonna click away and undo that with control Z to bring it back。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can see that solves the problem。 Now， what if I just delete one cell。
    I right click on this cell， I click delete Excelel is going shift cells around
    to try to replace the cell I'm destroying。 And you can see what it did。 It ruined
    the formula here。 It can't find the cell that it was referring to。 It's gone。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so it gives us a ref error for reference basically。 So how do you fix that。
    Well。 you can either undo。 you can realize that was a mistake。 I can't just delete
    this data。 or if you really have to delete the data， That's okay。 but just go
    into your formula by clicking on the cell with the ref error。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And you can double click on it and make the changes right there in the cell
    or you can just click once and then go up here to the formula bar。 whichever way
    you want to do it， you need to go in and fix the formula。 So this is where the
    error is。 I can just delete that。 and say， okay， C3 multiplied by。D3 tapap enter
    that fixed the reference。 Now the references are valid， and it's good。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's move on to the value error and you'll get the value error when you
    use the wrong function argument or often what it is is you're trying to combine
    different types of data that really don't go together。 So like a number plus a
    text or maybe you're multiplying a word by a number that won't make sense in most
    cases。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So let's look at our first example of mistakes that might lead to the value
    error。 Let's say over here on the right， I'm trying to multiply the number of
    packages by the quantity per package like I did here successfully。 But let's say
    instead of C2。 What if I were to put B。 So now I'm multiplying the third floor
    closet by 6 Let's see how that goes。 I tap enter。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I get the value error。 Why， because I'm combining two types of data that
    just don't go together text multipied by a number。ValueAnother example that's
    kind of common is， let's say， as I'm typing in the number 11。 What if I'm in a
    hurry and I accidentally put a space in there。 It still looks pretty good。 it
    looks like 11 to me。 but I tap enter on the keyboard， and I get a value error。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That extra space just doesn't compute as a number。 another example down here。
    let's say again。 I'm in a hurry。 And as I'm typing in the number 30， maybe I accidentally
    type in 30 instead of 30。 Let's say all caps is on。 and that looks like 30， but
    I tap enter。 again。 I'm combining things that just don't go together 30 multiplied
    by 4， that doesn't make any sense。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I get a value error。 Another fairly common mistake that will lead to
    the value error is sometimes when you put symbols in a cell with numbers。 Excel
    doesn't like that sometimes and you'll get a value error。 Now watch what happens
    if I put a dollar sign in there。Normally， you wouldn't do that。 You wouldn't just
    put a dollar sign in。Instead， you would select the cell and go up here on the
    home ribbon in the number group and click on dollar sign。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the proper way to show that these are dollars。 But from time to time。
    people will just go ahead and type a dollar sign。 Now that actually works。 it
    doesn't cause an error。 but other symbols often do cause errors。 For example。
    let's say I put a hashtag in there。 So hashtag 28。 maybe I'm trying to say number
    28。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I tap enter on the keyboard and I get a value error。 So watch out whenever
    you're putting in symbols like these and you're putting numbers also in the same
    cell that will often lead to a value error。 So when you get these value errors，
    take notice of what is in the cells。 and if there's a mistakes。 you need to fix
    them。 obviously I can go in and change it from B2 to C2 that'll fix that one In
    this case。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can fix the O and change it to0。 and in this case， I can get rid of the symbols。
    Now some of you may。Be noticing that my formulas are all messed up a little bit
    that's because of my previous example of the Ref error and how I deleted a cell
    notice that it moved everything up and that's why my formulas are a little bit
    off。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but the point remains that if you try to combine different types of data together
    in formulas if they don't go together you will probably get the value error Thanks
    for watching。![](img/9774656d6cb77a781bf14c68a3ef7483_2.png)
