- en: Alright， so the last thing I'll show you before we save and exit out of the
    notebook here is magic commands。 Now， this is kind of a cool name。 Magic commands
    makes you feel pretty powerful， and it does。 because these are pretty cool， so。😊。![](img/48c3eb139983bc807bec7c1942f7eacd_1.png)

- en: I will， let's see。 Let me copy over this link here。 Or actually。 if you just
    Google Jupiter magic commands。![](img/48c3eb139983bc807bec7c1942f7eacd_3.png)

- en: To a cool one， which is debug。So。Debug， for example， let's say that we break
    some code。![](img/48c3eb139983bc807bec7c1942f7eacd_11.png)

- en: So maybe I will say， you know， in this cell， let's say x equals。Hello worlds。And
    then we'll maybe say y equals true。And maybe if y well。 then let's try to do z
    equals 1 divided by 0。 So let's， let's break， let's break this code here。![](img/48c3eb139983bc807bec7c1942f7eacd_13.png)

- en: So we run this。This breaks。Let's type in debug， shall we because we want to
    debug our code。And this drops us in to this cell at the point of execution， right
    where our code broke。So if I print out why， for example。Then you see that y is
    true。 Maybe I want to try z equals 1 over0。 and you'll see that we get that zero
    division error。

- en: And so you're able to be dropped right into where your code breaks using this
    handy dandy Dbug magic command。 Now， there are a ton of other magic commands here。![](img/48c3eb139983bc807bec7c1942f7eacd_16.png)

    can change how the notebook runs all kinds of interesting stuff。 You can look
    at the history of what you've been running。All kinds of cool stuff。I would recommend
    at least scrolling through these so that you have an awareness of them in case
    you need to use them in。
