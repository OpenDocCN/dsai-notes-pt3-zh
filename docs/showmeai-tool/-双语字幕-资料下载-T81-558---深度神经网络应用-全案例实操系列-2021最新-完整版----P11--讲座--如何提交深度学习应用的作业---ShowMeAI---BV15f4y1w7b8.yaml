- en: Hi， this is Jeff Hayton， welcome to applications of Deep neuralural Networks
    with Washington University。 so there are 10 module assignments for my course，
    and these are short Python assignments that you'll complete just to prove your
    understanding of what we covered in each of these modules。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， when you submit them to my API that I have running。 there is a auto checker
    that runs and lets you know really how well you did on the assignment before I
    actually go through and grade it for real。 This just gives you a chance to submit
    it， resubmit it。 make sure that there's no simple errors there。 The final grade
    going into canvas occurs when I actually。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: when the due date passes。 and that's a semi automated process as well。But those。
    that's the point at which your grade actually goes into Canvas。Now I send out
    these API keys to Washington University students， if you're enrolled in my class。
    you should have gotten an API key from me if you did not please contact me and
    I will be sure to send you one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Usually I send these all out about a week before class actually starts。If you're
    not enrolled at Washington University， you just want to make use of the auto checker。
    then you can click on the Patreon link that is on the About page for my YouTube
    channel and I offer that at one of the levels。That's the only grading that I offer
    for anybody outside of Washington University outside of WasU。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can definitely look at all the videos， see all the assignments。 but I only
    actually grade the students who are actively enrolled in my course。![](img/bd9c255aeae7a8d8d4919211c00510f2_1.png)

- en: To see all my videos about Cale， neural networks and other AI topics。 click
    the subscribe button and the bell next to it and select al to be notified of every
    new video。Okay let's start with coab and see how we can submit an assignment using
    just that There are many different ways to go about this。 but this is just one
    way that will work and is pretty easy so if you go to the Github repository for
    the class Jeff Heaton T81 558D learning and if you go into assignments let's actually
    submit assignment1 assignment1 is very simple you just have to put your API key
    in this is what identifies you as a student and lets me track who has sent what
    you should have gotten that an email from me but if you for some reason did not
    send me an email and let me know so that I can send you now I only send those
    to Washington University students if you are not a Washington University student
    would like to use the autograding capability that's built into this class then
    there's options for that if you look on the Patreon support。

- en: Site that goes along with my YouTube channel。 Now this is assignment1。 It's
    Python code。 You'll notice that every notebook has this open and coabab link here。
    We'll go ahead and click that。 this opens it in coab now you can actually run
    the code but you have to go one step further you have to copy it to your Google
    Drive It says creating a copy and now it's here now I would say make it your own
    at this point。 So copy of assignment Jayton put whatever your name is for there
    I'll leave it as Jayton since that's me I've renamed it if you go to your Google
    Drive in Google Drive when you use coab you get this coabab notebook if you go
    into there you should see it looks like it hasn't completely renamed it from what
    I had to do there let's see save after you do the save now it's renamed Now that's
    a problem I've seen some students get hung up on is Google Drive does not always
    immediately up。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So you needed to do the save like I did there。 make sure that you can truly
    see it in Google Drive with the correct name。 And sometimes after you've saved
    it， you may have to wait a couple of minutes before you can actually submit your
    assignment usually you won't immediately download and then five minutes later
    submit it unless youre really。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: really fast at these but this is this is the first assignment。 I list some of
    the common problems that you can run into and what you might need to do to resolve
    those this first part here you'll need to run that is going to bring coab online
    and actually map your Google Drive into coab so that you can get access to it
    I'm going to go ahead and run this section see here how it says note not using
    Google Coab this should flip using coab once this comes through okay you've also
    got to do this This is very important。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is connecting coab to your G drive。 Unfortunately you're gonna to do this
    a lot。During the semester， they make you do this and redo it。 believe me I've
    done this probably 100 times。 click that。 You click allow。 This is your This is
    not your API key。 Don't be confused with this。 This is not what you're using to
    submit it。 This is just to connect coab to you G drive。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll go back to here'll go we have to go back to that copy one that you may。
    So yeah it's this one。'll paste that into there press enter and it's authenticating。
    this takes just a moment and it should show you this note using Google coab and
    Tensorflow 2。 is active This is a handy command that I give you I only put it
    in the first assignment。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but you can copy and paste it into the others if you so desire I'm going to
    run it。 This exclamation point means to run a unx command L is a unx command called
    list It's kind of like directory and dos And we are basically just listing the
    contents of my notebooks directory That's doing essentially the same thing as
    going over into Google coab I'm sorry。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is essentially doing the same thing as going over into Google Drive and
    looking and seeing that it's here so we'll go back to here so we can see it。 We
    will need this name， so I'm gonna go ahead and copy it。 but it's essentially it's
    the same one up here。 you could copy that as well This is the submit function
    I just provide this to you。 You don't really need to know how it works。 It's just
    an API call fundamentally over the web it calls a web address on my main server
    and that tracks all of these assignment submissions's all over Https So it's all
    encrypted just run this if you get an error saying can't find submit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It means you probably forgot to run this here is where you need to put your
    key This is the API key that I email to you。I am just going to magically move
    mine into my clipboard。 You would have probably actually gone and copy and pasted
    it from your email or wherever you wrote it down。 but I'm going to select the
    one that was there。 by the way， if I do run just the one that's there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will get an error。 actually I'll get a couple of errors。 let me use this just
    to demonstrate。 let's run thiss not going to work well。 No directory users J Heaton
    projects， blah， bla， b blah。 this is because the file name right here， which is
    the file name to the what you're trying to submit is not valid。 That's because
    I'm using the Mac Linux1， but I want to use this one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the Google coab one and you also need to change this so that it's your
    name All right。 so now it's got my name in there now let's run it。 Now if you
    get another message back saying can't find it。 look and make sure that you have
    this exactly like it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make sure that this matches what is up here， make sure that you've done file
    save and maybe use that list。Command that I gave you earlier just to be absolutely
    shirts there。 failing all of that。 Give it maybe five minutes。 Sometimes Google
    takes a little bit to synchronize。 Alright。 so that's for Bennon。 let me go ahead
    and put my API key in here。 So that's the key for me。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Don't use that one either。 It'll get deleted before class starts。 Those are
    just temporary keys that I use。 And all this is doing is submitting this hardcoded
    CSv file here。 which is essentially the truth table for exclusive or operator。
    but that's what this assignment is expecting。 So I'll click this takes it a moment
    to run。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And what this is doing is basically sending the assignment to me。 You don't
    get your grade yet。 but it does check it for you。 And it's fairly advanced checker
    reasonably advanced。 say you change something Like say this column here was named
    Z instead of a Now it'll get mad right now it's say no warnings on your data。
    You'll probably。Well， but no guarantee。 The final grade happens in canvas and
    you don't have a grade in canvas after you submitted this。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I will I will either manually put your grade in there or I have a automated
    process that runs every morning if it checks your code and it sees nothing in
    addition to what the auto checker checks it'll just it'll put full points in there
    for you if you're not late。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you do lose points if you submit these past the due date。 so don't don't do
    that。 if you submit it more than a week late you'll get a zero on it so also don't
    do that。 let me go ahead and run it now with that column renamed。 now the auto
    checker will detect something is wrong War solution headers AB but your headers
    are B and Z that's not good So you'll you can get warnings from it and feel free
    to resubmit。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can submit it until it's perfect。 that is the point of these 10 assignments
    to get you to try this and don't worry about you can submit this 10 times。 I mean，
    don't denial of service attached。Me or anything。 but you could submit it 10 times。
    And if your hundred and1 time is completely correct， you'll get an A on it。 That's
    just the way this works。 Go ahead and run it as long as that hundred and1 time
    is not late。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All right and it even tracks it， I've submitted a 13 times bad luck if you want
    to check this later on you can use this code down here I only put this code on
    assignment1。 but if you run this with that same API key in there。 well that just
    defines it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: then you run it here。 put my key in it shows me the progress for me on all these
    various assignments。 that was me probably testing the submits。 and then if I want
    to check just one assignment I can click this and that shows me specifically what
    warning I got on one particular assignment so that is how you use Google coabab
    to these I assume most of you will probably be doing that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but if you let's also see how we would do this from a Windows computer just
    locally it would be pretty similar for Mac as well I won't show Mac individually
    for this。 So first change into。![](img/bd9c255aeae7a8d8d4919211c00510f2_3.png)
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The directory that you downloaded the class into and make sure you have your
    Tensorflow environment activated to activate Tensorflow Jupiter notebook and it
    launches it go into the assignments folder if you weren't there already。 but this
    is assignments will go into assignment1 put it into Python 37 Tensorflow rename
    this so that as you don't open it coab This part here for the coab instructions。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can run that or you can run it totally up to you。 It won't prompt you for
    anything like it did when we were doing this in coab。 It'll just say not using
    Google coab and this command won't work in Windows so don't run that We'll define
    the submit function。 and now we're ready to submit it so I had magically copyied
    my key into the clipboard So there's my key make sure you change this so that
    the file name matches what your file name is called so the path is correct and
    we'll run that it helps to put this into the right format for。

    a project's directory。 So this has to match on your own computer。 that all matches
    assignment and then Jheton This is actually a good example。 So if you are getting
    that error go to a command prompt orel in users Jheaton you just check and make
    sure one by one these parts of it are correct T81 assignments assignment Jheton1
    IPy and B And if you can do Dr and see your command see your file there then it
    exists I'm just going to copy and paste I'm going to put this over top of this
    we have to do these double ses because that is how you properly encode a backf
    Try not to make any mistakes like I just did there and that worked So there was
    some minor typo I had in there but that's how I tend to validate pads so that
    was actually a good example I wish I could say I'd done that on purpose but that
    was obviously a。

- en: On my part。 So now you have it submitted， says no warnings on your data。 This
    does check your I'm repeating this sum from the coab。 but just in case you fastfored
    the coab part。 if I make something wrong with this。 it will now show you okay
    your headers are wrong or something like that。 This is an auto check。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll see your actual grade appear in canvas usually by the next day。 I have
    a second auto process that runs every morning and checks for submissions。 and
    if if it detects nothing wrong with your submission， it looks like it's a perfect
    score。 then it's just going to give you full credit in canvas and go on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it's something I need to check more specifically than I will go in and into
    your grade myself。 if you ever want me to look at what you've done in this code
    if you mess it up。 I will be looking at it because the auto corrector won't be
    able to figure it out and it'll send it to me。 But if you want me to just if you
    want any opinions for me on your coding technique or anything like that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I would be glad to。Look at any of these if the auto corrector has passed it
    through as as perfect and also once it's about a week past the due date。 which
    means if you haven't submitted you have a zero I will go through and release my
    solution file for each of these so you'll see how I actually did and I'll talk
    about it during the following weekly zoom meeting that we have Thank you for watching
