- en: 哦。So you have learned how to insert and update data in this lecture we're going
    to finish this section by learning how to delete data that is very easy。 we use
    the delete from statement to delete records from a table let's say the invoices
    table Now optionally we can add a search condition to identify the records we
    want to delete if you don't write this word class with this statement will delete
    all the records in this table and obviously that's very dangerous so be very careful
    when executing the statement。

    ID equals to one。Now here we can also use subqueries， let's say we want to delete
    all the invoices for the client called My works First let's find this client。
    so select everything from the clients table where name equals to my works。😊。Let's
    execute the second query。So。Here's our client。

- en: Now we can get this client ID and use it in our search condition。 So where client
    ID equals to。 this is where we add our sub queryry。😊，There you go， just like before。Beautiful。
    so this is how we can delete data in SQL。😊。![](img/eaf068e6bde73d21d7bbfe9147424a36_2.png)
