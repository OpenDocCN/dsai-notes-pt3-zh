    Washington University„ÄÇ Transfer learning is great„ÄÇ You can take existing learning
    and put it into your neural network„ÄÇ But where do we get these neural networks
    from In this video„ÄÇ we're going to look at how you can find„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ

    to see other videos like this on topics such as artificial intelligence„ÄÇ please
    subscribe to my YouTube channel by clicking the subscribe button and the bell
    that will notify you of every video that comes out„ÄÇ Thank you„ÄÇ Kiras comes with
    a number of models already built in that can be transferred in from their provider„ÄÇ

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it's important to know how to make use of those„ÄÇ We'll talk about them„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
    you can also find some models outside of Kiras„ÄÇ Like we did this with Yolo„ÄÇ Yolo
    is essentially transfer learning„ÄÇ We transferred in literally the entire of Yolo
    and also stylegan„ÄÇ but this gave us preexisting models to actually work with you
    could have custom and fine tune trained them further for sure„ÄÇ

    a lot of good information for you here„ÄÇ Tensorflow models zoo and papers with
    code„ÄÇ These two sites have a tremendous number of transfer learning capable„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ![](img/56e8d9866f4ec8a3da33b17a92d76bbd_3.png)

    at model zoo„ÄÇ you can see by the starsÔºå some of the ones that are the most popular„ÄÇ
    can also subscribe and get new ones„ÄÇ There's video„ÄÇ there's not just computer
    vision Yo with Tensorflow obviously is very popular right now„ÄÇ

- en: Lots of Gs and other things that you will see here„ÄÇ We will for the class„ÄÇ I'll
    give you links to the actual neural networks that we're transferring in and typically
    we're using ones that are already built into Kis„ÄÇ but if you want to look for
    projects of your own in the future„ÄÇ This is definitely a very valuable site to
    look at papers with code is also great„ÄÇ
  prefs: []

- en: This is where papers that were released with code or sometimes papers without
    enthusiast will write the code for the paper and publish it here very quickly
    So this this is another great place to look at to find neural networks that you
    may wish to transfer in for your own projects„ÄÇ

- en: I give you a listing here of all of the„ÄÇThat are built into Kias that you can
    actually load in The complete list is here if you go into the Kiras documentation
    these are the ones mobileNe will be using some of these others can be quite useful
    as well mobilenet is good because it's designed to run a mobile devices so the
    compute power that it needs is not great compared to some of these other ones
    a lot of these I I give you the links here you can click on the main link here
    and it will show you the actual paper typically that this is coming from usually
    you will have to read information from the actual paper to get an idea of what
    each of the networks is actually useful for and get some of the additional information
    the Kira's documentation gives you just the bare essentials to actually make use
    of it but I do give you a link here on the provided by Kiras to give you the information
    that Kiraas is given you to actually use this Now all of these weights are not
    downloaded when you install Kira„ÄÇ

    for the first time you'll see Cars in the background do a download so that it
    can pull down the weights from the original researcher it's very interesting these
    researchers who develop these who don't necessarily have the extensive compute
    power of some companies I've seen a couple of examples of Yo being used in industry
    where they tried to fine tune the Yolo weights where you can recognize multiple
    objects we saw the Yolo in a previous in a previous module but they often simply
    use Yo as it is because it's difficult to improve upon because it was done really
    well denseensenet a lot of these are attempts to give you pretrained networks
    that are deeper and deeper than ever before Resnets there's several versions of
    Resnet that are out there and Resnet can give you some very advanced feature recognition
    mobilenet and mobile„ÄÇ

    This lets you use a neural network that was trained extensively for mobile and
    internet of things„ÄÇ later in the class„ÄÇ we talk about how to actually do an IoT
    sort of deploy„ÄÇ So do neural network computation„ÄÇ both at the edge and in the
    cloud„ÄÇ

    of this of this course„ÄÇ And you can see in the descriptions Cf 10 and all the
    various image data sets that these were trained on„ÄÇ AgainÔºå more of the resnets
    Vg G is a very popular one as well„ÄÇ I have not worked with it a great deal„ÄÇ I
    don't tend to do a lot of computer vision in in my day job„ÄÇ
