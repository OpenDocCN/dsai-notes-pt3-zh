- en: This is the intermediate guide to Excel dashboards„ÄÇ And I hope you watched my
    beginner's guide to Excel dashboards„ÄÇ If you did„ÄÇ you know how I set these up„ÄÇ
    This is just the beginnings of a dashboard to track certain data that's in the
    rest of my workbook„ÄÇ You can see I've got three spreadsheets full of data„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I am highlighting these three pieces of data on my dashboard„ÄÇ in this intermediate
    guide„ÄÇ I'm going to show how to add some additional functionality to the dashboard„ÄÇ
    I'm also going show you how to dress it up a little bitÔºå make it look a little
    nicer„ÄÇ and then we'll finish by looking at how to pull data from a completely
    separate workbook„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and put it on the dashboard on this spreadsheet„ÄÇ So the first thing I'd like
    to focus on„ÄÇ If you look at this dashboard„ÄÇ This is nice„ÄÇ I can see the total
    gross sales„ÄÇ and I can see the total number of sales in the average cell price„ÄÇ
    And that's a good start„ÄÇ But from time to timeÔºå I might want to dig deeper into
    the data„ÄÇ and to help me with that„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to add some hyperlinks„ÄÇüòäÔºåOn the insert tab and here on the ribbon
    I'm just gonna add some text„ÄÇ and I'll click and add the text box hereÔºå and I'll
    just type click for more detail„ÄÇ and then I'll click here on the very edge of
    the text box and drag it to where I want it to be„ÄÇ I think that looks goodÔºå I
    might want to actually make that smaller„ÄÇ But whatever you want to do„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can adjust the look and feel of that text box„ÄÇ I really should group that
    text with the rest of this element of the dashboard„ÄÇ but that's okay for now„ÄÇ
    Now I'll triple click on the text to highlight it„ÄÇ Or if you prefer you can click
    and drag to highlight it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and then go back to the insert tab insert ribbon and look for the links group
    and just click the link button„ÄÇ and this pop up helps me decide what to link this
    text to„ÄÇ I don't want it to link to this existing file or any existing file really
    or to an email address or anything like that„ÄÇ What I want is this place in this
    workbook„ÄÇ and maybe I want to focus in on the data that's on my 2„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 20Spsheet here„ÄÇ So click O„ÄÇ So now when anyone clicks on that button„ÄÇ it takes
    them directly to the 2020 spreadsheetÔºå and they can see the underlying data„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
    going back to my dashboard spreadsheet„ÄÇ I actually might want to adjust that link„ÄÇ
    So I'm going right click on it and go to edit link„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because notice it's taking me directly to sell a1„ÄÇ and gross sales are actually
    in H1„ÄÇ So I'm going to change that to H1„ÄÇ click OÔºå And now when I click on the
    hyperlink„ÄÇ it takes me to H1„ÄÇ So that wayÔºå you can focus right in on the specific
    cell or part of a spreadsheet that you would like to link to„ÄÇ I could easily do
    the same thing with links for total number of sales and average sale price„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's look at some ways„ÄÇ I can dress up this dashboard and make it look nicer„ÄÇ
    I couldÔºå for example„ÄÇ go into my underlying data here„ÄÇ And I could create a chart
    to add to the dashboard„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ this may not make sense in this particular„ÄÇBut if
    I wanted to include a chartÔºå I could„ÄÇ I could click and drag to highlight one
    portion of the chart that I care about„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe the product titles„ÄÇ and then holding the control key„ÄÇ I'll move over and
    click and drag to select units sold„ÄÇ So with both of those selected I'm going
    to hold the alt key and then tap F1 on the keyboard and that brings up a chart
    of the data that I've selected„ÄÇ Now like I said in this caseÔºå the chart doesn't
    really tell me a whole lot„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but now with this chart I can right click on itÔºå cut it and then go to my dashboard
    and paste in my chart„ÄÇ And this chart has to do with units sold total number of
    sales„ÄÇ I suppose and I can put that where I want it to be„ÄÇ and it becomes an important
    part of my dashboard„ÄÇ Another way that I can dress up the dashboard is by going
    to view and looking in the show group„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Sometimes I like having the grid lines visible„ÄÇ but other times it just makes
    it look cluttered„ÄÇ So I'm going to remove the grid lines out of this spreadsheet„ÄÇIf
    I want to„ÄÇ I can also remove the headings so I get rid of ABC D etc ce„ÄÇ and the
    formula bar here„ÄÇ I could uncheck that and it's gone„ÄÇ NowÔºå what about the ribbon
    If I don't want the ribbon distracting from my dashboard„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it is possible to hide that If you go here to the upper right corner„ÄÇ It says
    ribbon display options and I can click to auto hideide the ribbon so it just goes
    away when I don't need it„ÄÇ if I need itÔºå I click here up at the top on the green
    and the ribbon appears and then if I click away„ÄÇ it hides again„ÄÇ Now if you don't
    want thatÔºå you can have it show tabs it'll only show the tabs or you can have
    it just do the default„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: show tabs and commands„ÄÇ I'm gonna go back and auto hideide the ribbon completely
    and now watch if I go back to the 2020 spreadsheet or the 2019 spreadsheet or
    2018 you notice that the ribbon is still gone„ÄÇ It's auto hidden„ÄÇ but I still do
    have the grid lines I still have my headings and so at least the option„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That I selected here in the view tab in the show group„ÄÇ those apply just to
    this particular spreadsheet that I'm working on in setting up as my dashboard„ÄÇ
    So that's a good thing to know„ÄÇ So the point of doing all of that is just to make
    the dashboard look nicer We want it to look attractive and to simply show the
    data that is important to me or to my audience or to the shareholders or whomever
    your audience is Another way to do that to make it look a little nicer is to adjust
    the zoom level„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is already pretty well zoomed in„ÄÇ but I want to adjust it a little
    bit„ÄÇ and normally I have in the lower right corner some zoom options„ÄÇ a slider
    basically that I can use to adjust the zoom because I've hidden the ribbon that
    option is gone„ÄÇ But if I click here up above on the green„ÄÇ it brings back that
    zoom level slider„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'd like to zoom in a little bit so I'm dragging that to the right that's
    a little too much I can just use trial and error to get that to the proper zoom
    that I want for it and then I can„ÄÇClick and I think that looks really pretty good„ÄÇ
    If I want to„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can pull this over a little bit to make that really centered well and look
    the way I want it to look Now„ÄÇ the final thing I want to show you how to do is
    to pull data not from another spreadsheet in the current workbook but rather from
    a completely different Excel workbook So you can see when I put my mouse down
    here on the Excel symbol on my taskbar„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it pops up with two workbooks„ÄÇ the one I've been working in and a second workbook
    where I'm tracking competitor average sales„ÄÇ let's say the company's competitors
    publish their data of their average sale price going back historically„ÄÇ and I
    want to use some of this information in my dashboard„ÄÇ let's look at how to do
    that„ÄÇ First of allÔºå I want to add another dashboard element„ÄÇ I could just copy
    paste what I have here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I clicked on it to highlight it control C to copy control V to paste„ÄÇ and
    now I've got another dashboard element„ÄÇ Now I'll adjust the text instead of average„ÄÇSall
    price„ÄÇ I'll call this competitors average sale price„ÄÇ My text is way too big„ÄÇ
    so I select it„ÄÇ and I'll shrink down the text„ÄÇ Still too big„ÄÇ There we go„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And of course I could have just adjusted the size of the box that the text is
    in but now the data itself I'm going to double click on it I get a cursor and
    I can delete that text„ÄÇ because I want to pull the number that goes here from
    that other separate workbook„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So next I'm going to click away from my shape and to do this properlyÔºå I think
    it makes more sense„ÄÇ if I click to bring back my ribbon and then I put in the
    formula bar„ÄÇ And I think I'll make the ribbon stay at least for now„ÄÇ So show tabs
    and ribbon„ÄÇ So now I'll click on my shape and delete the number that was there
    already„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and with the cursor flashingÔºå I'm going go up here and type equals here in the
    formula bar and then I'll just hold the alt key and tap tab and that shows me
    all of the options of the different windows and files that are open„ÄÇ I had to
    tap tab„ÄÇA couple of times until I selected the workbook that has the data I want
    to pull„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here it is 2020 average cell price of my competitor„ÄÇ and I select that cell
    tap enter on the keyboard„ÄÇ and look„ÄÇ it's now pulling information for my dashboardÔºå
    but it's pulling it from a separate workbook completely„ÄÇ I'm gonna go back to
    my workbook and the dashboard that I'm working on„ÄÇ Obviously„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could change the text„ÄÇ I could work to change the color scheme and things
    like that„ÄÇ I could change the background colorÔºå try to change the text color„ÄÇ
    but honestly„ÄÇ I'm pretty happy with the way it is right now„ÄÇ And now I can save
    this workbook and my dashboard should always have a connection between this workbook
    and the other workbook that I'm pulling the data from„ÄÇ So if this number gets
    updated in my second workbook„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It should update also on my dashboard in the current workbook„ÄÇüòäÔºåNow„ÄÇ if you
    pull data often from other workbooks into a dashboard from time to time„ÄÇ you may
    run into some problems„ÄÇ What if that other workbook gets deletedÔºå What if it gets
    moved„ÄÇ the link might get corrupted„ÄÇ So if that happensÔºå what you'll want to do
    is go to the data tab and look in the queries and connections group„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: there it says edit links„ÄÇ So you can click that and it will show you the links
    that it has„ÄÇ So this workbook only has the one link that I just created„ÄÇ I can
    click on it and click check status and it tells me the sources open„ÄÇ So I've got
    a good connection and the sources open„ÄÇ Now„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: if I close this pop up and go in and close that second workbook that I'm pulling
    the information from I can go back to the data tab„ÄÇ queries and connections groupÔºå
    click edit links„ÄÇ And this time if I click check status„ÄÇ It's got a connection
    stillÔºå but notice there is a warning values referring to other workbooks were
    not updated so I can click update values„ÄÇAnd that should update the values„ÄÇ I
    can change my source„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can open the source by clicking open source„ÄÇ It opens that other work book„ÄÇ
    There's just quite a lot of options that I have here to help me make sure that
    my links to other work bookss are still valid and working„ÄÇ So this has been the
    intermediate guide to Excel dashboards„ÄÇ From here„ÄÇ you could keep adding more
    dataÔºå more visual elements„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: like graphs and charts and make it look better and better and pull together
    just the information that you want to highlight onto your dashboard„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ![](img/f5736a42cae3095467764d512652e09b_2.png)
