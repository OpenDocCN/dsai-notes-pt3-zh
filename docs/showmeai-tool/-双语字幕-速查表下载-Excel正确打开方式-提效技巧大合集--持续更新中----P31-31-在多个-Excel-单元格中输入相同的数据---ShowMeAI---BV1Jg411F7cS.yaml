- en: In this short Excel video， I will show you how to enter the same data into multiple
    cells in Excel。 In a previous video， I showed how to use the autofill handle to
    enter the same data into multiple cells。 I can just type the word management here
    and then click on it and use the autofill handle in the lower right corner to
    click and drag and copy that data from one cell to the next across a range。 But
    what if that's not what you want。 If you look at this spreadsheet that I have
    here。

- en: This is an employee list。 It's got the employee' names， higher date。 employee
    numbers and the department that they work in。So I can't just use the autofi handle
    to drag this down and apply the word sales to every person who works in sales。
    Fortunately， there is a good way to do this。 As I build this spreadsheet。

- en: I can just identify who is on the sales team like Stevie here。 And let's say
    Corolla is also on the sales team。 What I need to do is just hold the control
    key and select D 9 in this case。 So that way， D 6 and D 9 are highlighted or selected。
    And maybe Nancy is also on the sales team。 So I click on Nancy's cell here。 and
    I'll go down to Renaldo and maybe Charrlena。

- en: And now I'll just type sales in the bottommost cell that I've highlighted。 And
    then the trick is to hold the control key and tap enter on the keyboard。 and look
    what it did。 It entered the word cells in all the right places。 We can do the
    same thing with communications。 I'll just click there。 I'll click there。 Maybe
    here and here and down at the bottom， Eileen。

- en: hopefully this will work。 I type in communications。 I tap enter and it didn't
    work。 why because I forgot to hold control。 So it's very important that when you
    type the word in the bottommost cell or the most recently clicked cell that you
    then hold control and tap enter on the keyboard。

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now it worked。 So in no time at all， I can fill this in completely just by clicking
    and then holding control to click on other cells that also need to have the same
    word or number inside them。 Just remember to hold control when you tap enter。
    Thanks for。😊。
