- en: In this video， I will highlight for you two powerful Excel functions。 and they
    are the large function and the small function。 And for some reason。 these are
    lesser known functions， even though they're more powerful and better in some ways
    than other more common functions。 and you can see here the spreadsheet that I'm
    going to use for this video is a list of student names and test scores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and this is all hypothetical not REL students。 So let's say I'm a teacher and
    I would like to take a look at these test scores。 and maybe I have not 20 students
    like are listed here， but maybe I have 50 students or 100 students。 and I would
    like to quickly scan and find the highest score and also the lowest score。 and
    what most people would do， if you have some experience with Excel is you would
    go to the cell where you want to display the highest number type equals max and
    then the left parenthesis and then simply select the range that you would like
    to test So I want to test the。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: To see which one is the highest score。 So I could click and drag to highlight
    them。 or even just click on column G to select the entire column。 and then I'll
    put the end parenthesis tap enter on the keyboard。 So that returns the highest
    score of 100。 and is that true。 Yes， it is。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This student here got a score of 100。 Now let's go to lowest score。 Most people
    would type equals min left parenthesis again。 select the range right parenthesis
    tap enter。 the low score is 58。 So that's fine。 But what if as a teacher， I want
    to highlight the top  three scores。 and maybe the bottom 3 scores。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， there are functions in Excel that are more powerful than max and min。
    And let's use those。 So here for top scores， I'm going use the large function
    to do that。 I just select the cell where I'd like to display the first place score。
    and I tap equals large left parenthesis and then I'll just select。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The range that I would like to test。 So I'll select all of column G。 But what
    makes large more powerful than max is that I can then put a comma and type in
    a number and this number will determine which of the scores is displayed。 If I
    put the number one it will list the number one largest number。 If I put two。 it
    will display the second largest number 3， the third largest5， the fifth largest
    etc。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll put one for the largest score。 the highest score close parenthesis and
    then tap enter on the keyboard。 it returns the number 100， which is accurate。
    and it's the same as we got with max。 but now watch what I can do。 I could type
    in the same formula again。 but this time here in cell J3。 And then instead I could
    put a2。 the easiest quickest way to do that is to simply copy this formula down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'm going to use the autofill handle if you're not familiar with the autofill。You
    should watch my videos on that topic。 But using that handle。 I just clicked and
    dragged and it copied the formula a couple of times Now I can double click on
    that formula and change the one to a2 and then just tap enter on the keyboard。
    and now it returns the second highest score。 we can look to see if that's correct。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it is Shan got the second highest score 99。 and now I can double click to
    alter this formula。 or sometimes it's better just to select the cell and then
    go up here to the formula bar and make the changes there。 Sometimes that's a little
    safer。 So I change the one to a3 in this case in order to display the third highest
    score。 I tap enter on the keyboard。 and there we have the top three scores，199
    and 95。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's do the same thing now， but with the lowest scores in J8。 I type equals
    I'll type small left parenthesis。 Next， I select the range to be tested。 so all
    of。GAnd then put a comma。 And now do I want the number one smallest number。 If
    so， I put a one。 If I want the second smallest， I put a two， Third smallest 3，5
    smallest 5 etc ce。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So I'll just do a one。 I want the smallest number write parenthesis。 tap enter。
    And we already know that that's correct。58 is the smallest number。 I'll use the
    autofill handle to copy this down。 but I do need to change the number from one
    in this case to2。 And in this case to 3。 Now， let's double check to make sure
    this worked。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you can see 58 is displayed twice as the lowest score and the second lowest
    score。 I that really accurate。 Well， Gustavo got 58。 And Elvin also got 58。 So
    that does appear to be correct。 Third lowest score 61。 and Lucreettia did get
    61。 So if you like Max and min。 Those are two useful functions。 But you may find
    yourself using large。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And small， much more often now that you know how to use them properly。 they
    really are better because they allow you to easily pull out more information than
    just what's the absolute highest and what's the absolute lowest。![](img/8910203555fedeaeb439f2b2dff4b9cb_2.png)
