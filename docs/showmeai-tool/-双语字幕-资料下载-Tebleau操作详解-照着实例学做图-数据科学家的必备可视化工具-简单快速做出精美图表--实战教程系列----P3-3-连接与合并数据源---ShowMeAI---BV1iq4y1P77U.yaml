    to be demonstrating how to union and how to join data sources within the data
    source window so we're going to create one data source out of multiple tables
    to do that I've created a furniture data set pretend furniture sales you can see
    that we have sales for three months September October and November we have a list
    of regional leaders we have a list of product leaders and we have the cost per
    unit and to。

- en: Create those to combine these into one big data source。 we're going go ahead
    and jump into Tau here。 You can see I've already created a connection to the furniture
    sales Excel sheet。 So the first thing we're going to do is we're going drag out
    September onto our sales or sorry onto our big furniture sales table here。😊。

- en: You can see that that gives us the sales for September Now we want to also combine
    this with the sales for October and November it would be a pain to have those
    as different data sources so we're going to go ahead and drag them out and you
    can see that if you drag them just underneath each other then you can drag them
    and drop them where it says drag to union and what that's going to do is it's
    going to stack the two tables one on top of the other so you can see that now
    we have September sales down here and October sales up at the top here we'll do
    the same with November just drop that on the bottom and again you can see that
    we have now September October and November in our data source the first big table
    you'll notice it's done two things and it's added two fields to our column the
    first one is the sheet name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，And the second one is the table name， both of these happen to be their month
    in this case。😊。So if we didn't have this month label in our data source。 we would
    actually be creating another label for each sheet so that we could identify which
    one was which。😊，The next thing we're going to do is we're going to join our regional
    leaders to our sales table here so we're going to take regionals out。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: drag it out onto the left hand side you'll see it gives us this little Venn
    diagram here this gives us a number of options for our join you can see that when
    the center of the Venn diagrams colored then we have an inner join when the left
    circle is covered we have a left join when the right circle is colored we have
    a right join and when both circles are colored we have a full join this has automatically
    picked up our join criteria so we have regional leaders in both。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，Columns， because region， the field region exists in both data sources。We also
    have this setup up as an inner join。 If you were to write this in SQL。 you would
    write inner join the two tables on region equals region。Now。 if we wanted to join
    a second table， we could join our product leaders here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We'll just drag that and drop that but you'll see that we have a red exclamation
    point because we don't have matching field names in these two so we need to select
    the field names from this little list it gives us。 so we'll go ahead and select
    product from the left data source and then if we look at this one you'll see we
    have product name So because that field is slightly different we have to specify
    the join criteria once we've done that it gives us the little inner join sign
    here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So again this will be the SQL equivalent of inner join product on。😊。A dot product
    equals B dot product name or something like that。So with those two tables。Joined
    up。We now have a pretty comprehensive data source rate， so we have all of our
    sales。 we have our regional leaders joined， and we have our product leaders joined
    so we can sum these up by different people。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: no matter what the region is and everything like that。😊，If we wanted to add
    the cost。 we can also drag the unit cost over here again。This is going to give
    us joining by product name that's exactly what we want we can also set this just
    so it joins off that main sales table we can set that by product then it's going
    to go ahead and join by product name I like to set up my join so that they're
    all set up like this when you do these joins the one thing that you have to bear
    in mind is that both of these fields have to be the same type so you can't join
    a numeric。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: 😊，A numeric column to a string column， even if they have the same information
    in them。 you have to make sure you convert them to convert them actually。 you
    can go down here and you can actually change the type of each column and there's
    a whole bunch of information that you can use down here You can also set this
    to a list Sometimes I don't want to see the data Sometimes you want to see a list
    that makes it a little easier to go ahead and change this icon so we could change
    this from a string to be a number to be true or false。

- en: And sometimes that's a good way to join things， sometimes you need to manipulate
    those in order to get the joins correct。 so once we go to the worksheet here，
    you'll see that Tableau organizes our fields nicely so we have all of our dimensions
    up here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: we have them organized by data table so we have product leaders regionals。 September
    plus which is our sales table and then the items from the unit cost table。😊。Or
    combined into one data source you'll see when you look at the blended data sources
    video that we have a similar setup。 but we have all of the data sources under
    different tables up at the top under data that about wraps it up for this episode
    of Tableau in two minutes if you have any questions please leave them in the comments
    there is a link to the workbook and to the data source in the video description
    and if you like what you're hear and you'd like more tableableau tips and tricks
