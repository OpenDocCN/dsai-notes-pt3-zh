- en: 哦。In this tutorial I'm going to talk about the implicit join syntax in My SQL
    so here we have a basic inner join。 we're selecting everything from the orders
    table， joining it with customer table on orders that customer ID equal to customers
    customer ID Pre basic There is another way to write this query using implicit
    join syntax Let me show you how that works。

- en: 😊，So。We select everything。From now here we can type out multiple table namess，
    so orders， comma。 customers， and we can also give them an alias， so C and O。And
    then we move this join condition to the where clause， so I'm going to copy this
    from here。 type out a where clause and paste the condition。😊，These two queries
    are equivalent。😊。

- en: What we have here is called implicit join syntax Now even though MyQ supports
    this syntax。 it's something that I suggest you not to use because if you accidentally
    forget to type out the work clauses。 you will get a cross join。😊，Let me show you
    what I mean。 So first I'm going to delete the first query。😊，And execute this。

- en: So we get 10 records because we have 10 orders in this database， so far so good。😊，But
    what happens。If we accidentally forget to type out the word clause。Instead of
    10 records。 we're going to get probably 100 records。Because every record in the
    order table is now joined with every record in the customers table。😊，This is what
    we call a cross join now later in this section I'm going to talk about cross joins
    in more detail。

- en: but what I want to point out in this tutorial is that it's better to use the
    explicit join syntax。 so we use join because this syntax forces you to type out
    the join condition。😊。If you simply join orders with customers without typing the
    join condition。 you're going to get a syntax error， so to recap， be aware of the
    implicit join syntax。
