In this short Excel video， I will show you how to enter the same data into multiple cells in Excel。

 In a previous video， I showed how to use the autofill handle to enter the same data into multiple cells。

 I can just type the word management here and then click on it and use the autofill handle in the lower right corner to click and drag and copy that data from one cell to the next across a range。

 But what if that's not what you want。 If you look at this spreadsheet that I have here。

 This is an employee list。 It's got the employee' names， higher date。

 employee numbers and the department that they work in。

So I can't just use the autofi handle to drag this down and apply the word sales to every person who works in sales。

 Fortunately， there is a good way to do this。 As I build this spreadsheet。

 I can just identify who is on the sales team like Stevie here。

 And let's say Corolla is also on the sales team。 What I need to do is just hold the control key and select D 9 in this case。

 So that way， D 6 and D 9 are highlighted or selected。 And maybe Nancy is also on the sales team。

 So I click on Nancy's cell here。 and I'll go down to Renaldo and maybe Charrlena。

And now I'll just type sales in the bottommost cell that I've highlighted。

 And then the trick is to hold the control key and tap enter on the keyboard。 and look what it did。

 It entered the word cells in all the right places。 We can do the same thing with communications。

 I'll just click there。 I'll click there。 Maybe here and here and down at the bottom， Eileen。

 hopefully this will work。 I type in communications。 I tap enter and it didn't work。

 why because I forgot to hold control。 So it's very important that when you type the word in the bottommost cell or the most recently clicked cell that you then hold control and tap enter on the keyboard。

 Now it worked。 So in no time at all， I can fill this in completely just by clicking and then holding control to click on other cells that also need to have the same word or number inside them。

 Just remember to hold control when you tap enter。 Thanks for。😊。
