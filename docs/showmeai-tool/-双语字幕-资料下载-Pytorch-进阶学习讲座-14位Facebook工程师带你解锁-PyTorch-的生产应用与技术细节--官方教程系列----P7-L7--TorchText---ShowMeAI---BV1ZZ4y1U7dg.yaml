- en: Hello everyone， welcome to PyTchDeveloper Day for 2020。My name is George。 I'm
    a software engineer at Facebook， I work for the text domain in Pytot。My job at
    Facebook is to support the PyToch user， especially in the text domain for research
    to production。 so in this talk I will go over some major update in 2020 and help
    you understand how our work can facilitate your research and production for the
    PyToch。

- en: So why we want to have a text domain in addition to Pyth。First。We want to accelerate
    NLP research and provide some reusful orthogonal and correct building block for
    cutting edge research。Based on our knowledge for the text domain and the research
    community。We want to work with the both internal team and external open source
    community to build a pipeline like can better support。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Both the Facebook products and external research。Second。😊。We want to provide
    a solution to transfer from research to production。What we mean here is we integrate
    those pipeline and module with a wide range of py capabilities such as touchscript
    quantization。 distribute data parallel and mobile with this goal we want to have
    a better support for research to production transition for most end an NLP pipeline
    thirdly we want to engage with the community and Disc novel technology。

- en: As people notes， the NRP domain。Move very fast。 So the text domain in Pyth team
    want to develop a good technology understanding。In the NLP area and build a new
    research collaboration。For the future community。With those go in mind， we provide
    those easy access to data sets。Text processing pipeline。And some NLP related module。So
    if you have time， please go over those one by one。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: our row text data set， the transform。And our more some NP related module， I
    will go。 go over this one by one with you。![](img/aaa011e1dc72912baa590f68c0c043cd_5.png)

- en: Okay， so the new data set in To text。We have also rewrite a few existing data
    set in To text nightly release。So here。For the nightly release， we consider those
    new stuff as a prototype。 So we will release those new data sets with our。😊，Better
    release very soon。So the new data set show here are fully compatible with data
    loader in Py。

- en: User will have the flexibility to build the data processing pipeline with some
    standard tokenizer and vocabulary blocks。Okay， here I list all the new data set
    available to our user in our beta release。 at same。 you may wondering， once I
    have those raw data， what should I do to convert this raw data into。

- en: A tensor like can be used to train a model okay， so here we provide some improved
    performance we provide some data pipeline with improved performance。With some
    C+ plus extension。So the goal here is we want to have an easy transfer to production。Here's
    the overview of some end to end pipeline with Ptoch and Torch text。The row data
    string read and send to a field transform here here you can see like tokenizer。

- en: So currently we are rewriting this data processing transform as an orthogonal
    building block with the G port。So after this after this step， we call this a pre
    processing。 The data are sent to data loader and sampler， where we generate。They
    have bachelor。Then the data are ready for the model。So we are do our best to write
    those a building block。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: individual building block， like so you will have the full flexibility to combine
    them together。And with the C++ extension， we are able to support the Gt for all
    this transform。And we believe that's a better support for the production。Okay，
    so now we go to the。The NLP related module， so we released a new multiha attention
    module in Tor text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: so in addition to the dropping replacement， if you are using the multiha attention
    in Pytoch co library。 we support the dropping replacement so you can easily switch
    from a Pytoch multiha attention to To text multiha attention。In addition。The new
    multi attention container also for touch script。Based on the feedback from our
    user， we add the incremental decoding and the broadcasting support。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The idea for this new multi high attention container is to facilitate user with
    some novel research idea under the transformer architecture。Right now， the transformer
    architecture is very popular across the text， audio and vision domain。We hope
    here like we can provide a very flexible multiha attention module so our user
    can apply this with different idea here I give you an example like how you switch
    from the Pych multiha attention to our Tosh text multiha attention container。

- en: Just with this a few lines。User has more flexibility to try different custom
    component with the concept multi attention。You can put。Custom in projection container，
    multihaitation container。O skilled dog products。 you can apply different idea
    with this multi hair attention container。

    the one to show how to use the new data set for text classification analysis。Please
    check out those tutorial and have some idea about how to write those into an NLP
    pipeline。Keep in mind， like we will also update this tutorial and to show how
    to build the N to N pipeline with the。

    watching this video。 and I hope you enjoy the Pytor Develop day for this year，
    and I will see you around。![](img/aaa011e1dc72912baa590f68c0c043cd_13.png)
