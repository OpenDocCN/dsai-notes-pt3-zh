- en: In this video， we will look at how to easily create an organization chart or
    org chart in Microsoft Excel。 And you can see here at the left， I have a list
    of names of people that work in an organization and I would like to organize them
    into a hierarchy and org chart on sheet2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you'll notice that I have a sample USDA organization chart。 And let's say that
    I work for the USDA。 And I've been asked to follow this pattern and create an
    org chart for the organization。 By the way。 you have access to this practice file
    if you look in the description below the video。 So how would I go about creating
    this org chart in Microsoft Excel。 Well。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: one of the best ways to create an org chart in Excel is by clicking here on
    insert and using the smart art option。 If I click on smartar， you'll see that
    a huge number of smart art shapes are available There are processes there are
    cycles that you can use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And these smart art objects are easily customizable and changeable and they're
    useful in many different ways。 you can see that there are matrices that you can
    add。 there are pyramids different types of pictures graphic organizers just a
    wealth of smart art shapes and visuals that you can use I'm going to go down to
    hierarchy and you can see that each one of these hierarchies could be used as
    an org chart you can put the CEO here at the top the vice president here or however
    you want to organize the org chart for your organization So select the org chart
    that matches what you want the best。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to simply select the default org chart you can see there's some details
    here about it and then just click and I have an org chart that's added right on
    top of my Excel spreadsheet and it really is on top of it you can see that I can
    click and drag to move。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: The org chart。 and it just floats on top of the spreadsheet cells。 If I want
    the org chart to be bigger， I could click and drag at the corners to resize the
    org chart。 It's probably premature to do that， though， as you'll see in just a
    minute。 Okay。 so now let's begin adding people to this org chart。 If I switch
    back to sheet 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can see that the secretary goes here at the top。 So I'll switch back to sheet
    1。 let's say that Charles Love belongs there。 I could click here on text and type
    in Charles love。 Not that the text resizes in order to match the space that's
    provided。 you can also click and drag to change the space itself。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So going back if I had started by resizing the space that I have in that box。
    Notice that the text would have been handled a little differently。 I actually
    like how Excel handles this， And so I could just click here to type in the text
    and it will adjust。To exactly the width and size that it needs to be。 But I want
    to show you that sometimes it's better to type in the names or other text here
    at the left using this panel。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: instead of clicking and typing in the box itself， simply click over here and
    type the names。 If I wanted to， I could also type in titles， So deputy secretary
    Charles love。 But for brevity。 I'm just going to leave the names themselves。 at
    this point。 I could just click here to add the next person in the org chart。 But
    if you recall， here on sheet 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the way this org chart is set up is different than the hierarchy I was given
    in Excel。 How can I duplicate this。 How can I match it。 so that these other people
    are considered almost siblings not children but siblings of the deputy secretary。
    Well， back on sheet1。 the way I could do that is by right clicking on the Charles
    love box。 And then I could go here where it says add shape and。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I could simply choose to add the shape after the Charles Love shape。 So if I
    click that。 it adds a shape to the right of Charles Love。 Now， this is an unusual
    situation。Normally the links are automatically provided when you add a new shape。
    But in this case。 for a very good reason it didn't do that。 And so I may need
    to go in and insert a line that shows that relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， I can click on the box or simply go here and click on the panel and I could
    type in Tyler Fraser。 Now， one nice advantage to having the text right here in
    the same spreadsheet or on another sheet is that you can click and copy with control
    C and then click either on the box or here on the panel and then paste in the
    text。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So that is an advantage in some cases， it might be a little faster to do it
    that way。 And at this point， I just want to start working on this part of the
    org chart。Going back to sheet1。 you'll notice that I probably don't need this
    particular box。 I can just click on it to select it and then tap delete on the
    keyboard， and it's now been removed。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And so I could just continue to click on and copy the various names and then
    paste them here。 Now let's try copy pasting more than one name at a time。 How
    will that go if I click and paste it here， noticeice that it put both names in
    automatically。 Now， what if I decide that I need to add a new sibling to Ignatio
    Fowler or a new child to Charles Love。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， I could select  Ignatio Fowler， right click and choose add shape， add
    shape before。 let's say I want the new person to be listed here。 Watch what happens
    when I add the shape before。 Now I have a new shape and it's before Ignatio Fowler。
    So that's gonna be Dana Strickland and I'll just paste her name right in there。
    So from here。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can just continue to add more。And more names and more organization to this
    org chart。 Let's say that Juana Mills is a team leader。 I could right click on
    Juana Mills。 and I could add another shape。 This is going to be a shape below
    And I want to list out her team each team member with their own box。 Now， because
    I just created this new box to add another box。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: all I have to do is click back on Juana Mills and tap the F4 button。 and that
    will add another child， let's say to Juana Mills。 So I could pretty quickly add
    a whole team underneath Juana Mills。 and I could copy paste their names right
    here into the panel。 and delete any unneeded shapes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just like with most objects that you add in Excel。 the smart art org charts
    that you make can be clicked on， and when they're selected。 you get additional
    tabs here at the top。 So there is a smart art tab and it has some pretty exciting
    options。Here you could have kind of a 3D effect to your org chart。 you could have
    it be kind of bevellled。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You could choose some of these other styles or options that you can look through。
    You can even change the color so I could adjust it to a varied color or I could
    go to all orange there's lots of different options here for the colors of your
    org chart if you want to you can click reset graphic to reset it back to the way
    it was you can also change the type of hierarchy of your org chart if you remember
    back at the very beginning when I added the smart art。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I chose the basic hierarchy but if you want to you can switch it to something
    else you can even just put your mouse on top of these other layouts to get a preview
    of what it would look like and if you think it's better than the original go ahead
    and switch it I'm going to stick with this original layout。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I also have a format tab here at the top I can change how the text displays。
    I don't particularly like that look but if。W to。 I could switch to that。 I can
    also change the shape fill。 So the background of my org chart。 I can even use
    gradients by going down here。 I can use textures So you can make these org charts
    pretty fancy if you would like to。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to undo a few times just to take us back to the way it was I like
    this look pretty well。 Now， you may have noticed that my solution for Tyler Fraser
    and connecting him to Charles love using this line is kind of annoying。 Every
    time the chart adjusts this line seems to be out of place。 So let's look for another
    better option for connecting Tyler Fraser to this org chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: One option would be to simply add another shape， but instead of choosing add
    shape after I can choose add assistant。 And then I can click and drag that assistant
    to the place I want the assistant to be。 So I'm going to delete Tyler Fraser，
    and I'll pull the assistant up here and off to the side and。

- en: I'll copy paste Tyler Frazer here as an assistant to Charles Love so even though
    you can certainly add your own shapes and lines and things to the org chart。 it's
    often better to simply use the built in hierarchy tools here as you add shapes。
