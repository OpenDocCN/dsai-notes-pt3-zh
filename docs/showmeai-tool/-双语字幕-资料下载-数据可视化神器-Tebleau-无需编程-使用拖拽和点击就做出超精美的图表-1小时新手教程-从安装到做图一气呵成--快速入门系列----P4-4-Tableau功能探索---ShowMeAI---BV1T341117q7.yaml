    can open recently created workbooks， create a new one by connecting to a data
    source or explore tableau content from the community。The page is consisted of
    three different panes。Connect， open and discover。The rightmost part is the discover
    pane Through this pane。

    page allows users to establish the data connection， to blend the data。 to filter
    the data， and apply basic adjustments to the fields or columns。The page consists
    of four main areas， left pane， canvas， data grid and metadata grid。

    connections。 the database or schema will be the one listed。By using the drop down。
    you can edit the current connection， remove or rename it below the connection
    is the list of available sheets。 Here we have orders， returns and users， which
    are the sheets contained in the Excel file we inserted earlier。

    the tableau logo。 which will show the start page and the refresh button。 will
    refresh the data source on the upper right of the data source page is the canvas。
    which has two layers。 But first， let's drag in the order sheets and return sheets
    to the canvas and apply their data relationship。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is the logical layer of the canvas。 It is where you can create relationships
    between logical tables。To show the other layer of the canvas， double click on
    one of the tables or sheets。 This shows a new window， which is the physical layer
    of the canvas。It is where we can add joins and unions between tables。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We will learn more about this as we discuss how to use multiple data sources。Below
    the canvas is the data grid。It shows the first 1000 rows of data from the connection
    or file that we indicated。We can use this to apply general modifications to the
    data source， such as sorting and hiding fields。 renaming， changing data type，
    and creating new calculated fields。Next。

    grid。 This pane shows all of the fields in the selected table， their table name。
    and their remote field name。Next， let's navigate to the tableableau workspace
    by clicking sheet 1 on the tab beneath the page。 The tableableau workspace is
    where we will mostly reside when we create a chart。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL

    A view is the visual representation of data or the chart itself， which is inside
    the worksheet。![](img/5d3494cd1cecc82c7a938686e657824d_8.png)

    tab is the dashboard tab and the story tab。 which has basic dashboard and story
    functions。Most of its functions are not available since we are currently editing
    a view instead of a dashboard or story。

    by name or data source order。The analytics plane lets users apply advanced analysis
    to the view such as constant lines。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: forecasts and reference lines。 The center canvas is the work area。 This is where
    our visualization is presented。The cards and shelves surrounding the work area
    are used to indicate how the view will be placed and shown。 The columns and rows
    shelves create the structure of the chart。 The fields are placed in these shelves
    to indicate whether it will be the value on the header or on the axes。
  prefs: []

- en: Below the filter shelf is the Marx card。This is a key element for visual analysis
    in tableau。 because you can add context and detail by dragging fields into the
    different visual properties of the marks card。 Let's try creating a view as an
    example。 Dr the customer segment into the rows shelf。 This creates four rows of
    customer segment values in a table view。 Next。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: drag the profit field from the data pane and place it after the customer segment
    on the row shelf。This will automatically create a bar chart of the sum of profit
    by customer segment。 Now。 add an order date to the column shelf。 It turns the
    bar chart into a line chart because we have added a continuous field as our column。
    Finally， drag a region field into the marks card and place it on color。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This sets a regional granularity to each line chart by segment where each region
    is separated by a different line and color。 The page shelf lets you break a view
    into a series of pages so you can better analyze how a specific field affects
    the rest of the data in a view。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: For example， let's drag the order date from the column shelf and place it on
    the page。 This separates the view by year of order date where we can flip through
    each year by using the controls on the right panel。 The show me button on the
    upper right。 lets users select a chart or view type by highlighting the possible
    charts that the view。😊，Can be converted into the chart with orange outlines is
    selected to be the best match for the indicated data。
