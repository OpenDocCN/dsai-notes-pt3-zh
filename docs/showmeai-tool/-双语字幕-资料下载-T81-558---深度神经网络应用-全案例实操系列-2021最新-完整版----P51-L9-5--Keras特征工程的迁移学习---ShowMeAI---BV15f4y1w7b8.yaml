- en: Hi， this is Jeffeine， welcome to applications of Deep neuralural Networks with
    Washington University in this video we're going to continue with transfer learning
    and we're going to see how you can use neural networks that you've trained yourself。For
    feature engineering and dimension reduction for the latest on my AI course and
    projects。

- en: click subscribe and the bell next to it to be notified of every new video。 Transfer
    learning can also be used for feature engineering。 Sa， for example。 you were going
    to classify images， but not just the image。 Maybe you wanted an image of somebody。
    And you were going to put other statistics in there as well， like their age， their
    gender。

- en: and other things so that maybe the neural network might give you some health
    assessment for them。 again， using a life insurance industry example， which is
    what I do for my my day job。Here we're going to simply look at how you might rip
    off。The top layer of one of these neural networks that you typically transfer
    and use what's underneath for feature engineering。

- en: I'm going to go ahead and run this introductory part where basically this is
    code like we had before I am grabbing。Essentially， an image here， it's a soccer
    ball。And I display the soccer ball and I leave the neural network so that there's
    not an output layer。

- en: This is like we were going to do a transfer learning。Except。Let me actually
    go ahead and display the model summary。So if I run that。 I can see now the typical
    input for a 224 by 224 image that comes in。Go through all of these and instead
    of classifying it into the 1000。Images that。

- en: Were the classification classes for this type of a neural network。 we're taking
    the final layer that it was trained on， which just so happens to be a vector of
    1024。So you can see basically here is that vector of 1024。 It's relatively sparse。
    which is kind of interesting so it's。These are essentially the feature types that
    the dense layers at the end of this would have learned to recognize and classify
    it。

- en: You can simply pull these off and use those as engineered features。As part of
    your feature vector。 So your you would have your 1024 values that came from whatever
    image you had classified。 and it's not classifying that all the way to soccer
    ball。 It's classifying it to all of those individual features that you see here
    that the dense layers would have been able to use to tell that it's a soccer ball。

- en: So you're getting that raw feature engineered input that the CNN has produced
    for you。 And that can be then used as a way to encode。An image， or just like we
    saw in the last part。 you can do something very similar to encode a。String value
    for natural language processing with an embedding layer。

    to look at time series。 This content changes often。 so subscribe to the channel
    to stay up to date on this course and other topics in artificial intelligence。😊。
