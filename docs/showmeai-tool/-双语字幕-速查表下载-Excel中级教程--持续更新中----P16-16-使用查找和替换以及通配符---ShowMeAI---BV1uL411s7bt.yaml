- en: In this Excel tutorial， I will show you how to use the find and replace feature
    in Excel to locate data in your spreadsheet。 So here I have a spreadsheet of movie
    titles and some information about those movies。 But let's say I want to quickly
    check to see if I've included a specific movie。 All I have to do is hold the control
    key and tap F。 and it brings up find and replace。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's look first at find。 So with the find tab selected。 I can just type in
    what I'm trying to locate。 let's say the movie dark night。 After typing it in。
    I can just tap enter on the keyboard or click find next。 and it locates that data。
    Now。 if that's all I needed， just to verify that the data is there。 that I'm done。

- en: But sometimes I might want to find and replace with something else。 So maybe
    it should be titled the dark night。 instead of just dark night。 I can type that
    in。 click replace。And if there is more than one instance of this problem。 I could
    just click replace all， and it would fix all of them。 I click， O。

    error。 You can have Excel。 Find all instances of that error and replace them with
    the correct data。 Now。 what happens if you know that you're looking for something
    but you don't know exactly what that is。 you're not quite sure what mistake you
    made， but you know that you probably made one。

- en: or let's say you're looking for all data in Excel that is similar。 What you
    can do is you can use wild card characters in Excel。 So let's look at the wild
    card symbols。 We have the question mark and we have the asterisk。 Those are the
    two main wild card symbols。 So let's say I'm looking for some movies that include
    the letters S T in the name。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But maybe I'm not sure what comes next。So after the S T， I could put in a question
    mark。 and that question mark is a wild card。 It can represent any one character。
    So S T followed by any character at all， and then followed by an R。 Any example
    of that should be found when I click find next， So let's try it out。

- en: It found the court jester， because S T E R， the question mark can fill in for
    that E。 Let's find the next one。 Western， it found the word Western Star Trek
    4 and star Wars。 So each of those is found when I use this question mark wild
    card。 because it can replace any one character。 Okay， let's try it again but this
    time。

- en: let's use the asterisk wild card。 So S T asterisk R。 the asterisk can fill in
    for any number of characters。 So this should find any data in this。Spreadsheet
    at all that has an S T and as many characters as possible。 and then followed by
    an R。 So let's try that。 It found Western。 It found Star Trek and Star Wars。

    search result。 St brew。 So find and replace is a very useful tool built into Excel。
    You can use it to find data to find and replace data。 And when you need to remember
    to use the question mark and the asterisk。

- en: which are your wild cards to help you find data that you may not know exactly
    how to spell or if you've made spelling mistakes。 but you still want to be able
    to locate it。 Thanks for watching。 I hope you found this tutorial to be helpful。
