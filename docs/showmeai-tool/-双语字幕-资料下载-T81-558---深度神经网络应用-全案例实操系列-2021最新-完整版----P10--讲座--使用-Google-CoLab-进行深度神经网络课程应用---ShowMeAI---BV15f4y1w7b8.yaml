- en: HiÔºå this is Jeff Heaton„ÄÇ Welcome to applications of deep neural networks with
    Washington University„ÄÇ In this videoÔºå I'm going to introduce Google Coab„ÄÇ and
    I'm going to show you how to make use of Google Coabab to run the various modules
    from this course and also how to use it to submit assignments„ÄÇüòäÔºåMost things will
    work in Google Coab„ÄÇ In factÔºå most things in this course will run quite a bit
    faster in Google Coab due to the fact that it gives you a GPU„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now you might have a superior GPU to Google Coabab on your local machine„ÄÇ and
    if that's the case„ÄÇ then I definitely encourage you to install the GPU edition
    of Tensorflow on your actual computer„ÄÇ howeverÔºå it can be somewhat complex to
    get the GPU working in TensorFlow For the latest on my AI course and projects„ÄÇ

- en: Google Coab can be a great way to get through this course„ÄÇ You can do the entire
    course completely in the cloud using Google Coab„ÄÇ just a few things you need to
    be aware of„ÄÇ And that's what I'm going to take you through this video„ÄÇ First of
    allÔºå just to get into Google Coab„ÄÇ I recommend just do a Google search on Google
    coab and it'll take you right to it„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's coab researchÔºå Google co I've also got a link to it on my course website„ÄÇ
    Now when it pops you into Google CoabÔºå you're gonna see a lot of things going
    on here„ÄÇ I have used this for a number of different things„ÄÇ So I'll have a lot
    more files in here probably than you will„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: All of your notebooks that you're going to work on„ÄÇ are going to be stored in
    your Google Drive„ÄÇ So let's go ahead and show you how you could get say the veryÔºå
    very first module 1 course 1„ÄÇ Click on Github and you will type Jeff Heaton all„ÄÇüòä„ÄÇ![](img/9b3166bd64e1d412ba7306144df7359f_3.png)

    this„ÄÇ This is actually the first time Ive I've seen this„ÄÇ Apparently„ÄÇ I have been
    using Github in conjunction with coab enough that they want me to authorize the
    API access„ÄÇ This is just fineÔºå I will go ahead and click that„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and authorize Google Coab wants me to log into here„ÄÇ OkayÔºå now we're authorized„ÄÇ
    it probably won't ask you for that at firstÔºå But if it does definitely go ahead
    and author so that you can get to things„ÄÇ Now it'll say Jeff Heaton„ÄÇ and it gives
    you all of my repositories„ÄÇ And there is a considerable number of these„ÄÇ This
    is the one you want„ÄÇ T 81Ôºå5Ôºå58 deep learning„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's the course number at Washington University„ÄÇ The first things you'll see
    up here are the assignments„ÄÇ and these assignments will get to that in a moment„ÄÇLet's
    go ahead and just open up class1 module 1„ÄÇ This is a notebook„ÄÇ So it opens up
    here and you can basically see this right now„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it is not saved to your G drive„ÄÇ If you want to copy it to G drive and that's
    a good idea„ÄÇ you'll have to do that when you submit assignmentsÔºå but let's just
    go ahead and copy that„ÄÇ So it'll create a copy of it„ÄÇ You'll see the name of here„ÄÇ
    It says copy of T 81„ÄÇ That is literally going right into your G drive„ÄÇ If we go
    into G drive„ÄÇ And again„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I have all sorts of things in my Google Drive that you probably will not„ÄÇ but
    you'll have a directory called coabab notebooks„ÄÇ This is where Google coabab places
    all of your notebooks„ÄÇ So here's the copy of this one„ÄÇ I would suggest renaming
    it to to something else„ÄÇ So here we are in Google coab„ÄÇ

- en: About the intro to this classÔºå but this little bit of Python code here to run
    for the Python versions„ÄÇNowÔºå notice hereÔºå it is 2„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ0„ÄÇ GoogleÔºå at least as of
    this recording has not yet updated coabab to 2„ÄÇ0 of TensorflowlowÔºå I suspect that'll
    happen sometime this semester„ÄÇ So this is why I end up rerecording this video
    just about every single time„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I'm going to run this and we'll see that it'll go to one of the1„ÄÇ something
    versions of it„ÄÇ Yeah„ÄÇ so 1„ÄÇ14Ôºå which is a pretty recent version„ÄÇ I've made sure
    that all the code in here„ÄÇ or at least most of it is compatible with coabab„ÄÇ The
    parts that aren't„ÄÇ which is probably less than 10% of the course„ÄÇ I give you a
    warning as to why that is„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and I also don't make any of the assignments require any features that are not
    supported by Google Coab„ÄÇ NowÔºå notice hereÔºå it says GPU is not available„ÄÇ This
    is a really cool thing about Google Coab„ÄÇ Let's go to runtime„ÄÇ change runtime
    type„ÄÇ We'll leave that„ÄÇThe same„ÄÇ But let's put in a GPU„ÄÇ Now it says GPU is available„ÄÇ
    Later onÔºå this will really save you some time in executing these programs„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So this shows you how to basically get the course modules over to Google coab
    if you want to run them unfortunately„ÄÇ you need to copy them sort of one at a
    time like this„ÄÇ You could download and this would be a quick way to do it„ÄÇ You
    could download the entire Github repository and basically just copy the files
    into your G drive and then they would show up and they would be available„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now let's see how to actually submit an assignment using Google coab„ÄÇ So if
    we go back to coabab and we essentially try to open a notebook„ÄÇ We'll go right
    back to Github just like we were before„ÄÇ It's annoying„ÄÇ it wants me to keep reauthorizing
    that„ÄÇ It defaults to the assignments„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and that's just because assignment starts with a so we're„ÄÇ![](img/9b3166bd64e1d412ba7306144df7359f_7.png)

- en: Going to do the class1 assignment real quick here I've opened it up and we absolutely
    have got to copy it to your Google Drive or it won't work„ÄÇ You will want to change
    the name of it„ÄÇ Don't do copy of just call it assignment and I'm gonna assignment
    J Heaton„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: make that your own name and class1 put your name in here„ÄÇ and here's the instructions„ÄÇ
    some common problems that will go on„ÄÇ you're going to basically use this submit
    function„ÄÇ So go ahead and run this so that the submit function is built„ÄÇ This
    is simply a function that I provide for you„ÄÇ We're not going to talk really about
    how it works„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's more just a utility for using this course„ÄÇ This is an important part„ÄÇ You'll
    want to do this so that you can basically use files from your Google coab inside
    of your notebook„ÄÇ This will let you be able to submit your assignments and also
    some of the coursework has you down„ÄÇload a Cv file as your input data or images
    or other things„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You'll need to copy those to your Google G drive and then access it through
    this„ÄÇ So let's see how that works„ÄÇ We're going to go ahead and run this„ÄÇ And it
    is going to ask me to authenticate this as well„ÄÇ I need an authorization code
    from Google„ÄÇ I click this„ÄÇ And here is my authorization code„ÄÇ I don't believe
    you can do anything bad with this because I don't think they last very long„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but I'm going to go ahead and blur this just to be safe„ÄÇ put it into hereÔºå press
    enter„ÄÇ and now it's mounted„ÄÇ It's mounted at this location„ÄÇ So you'll want to
    prefix your files with thatlash contentlash drive just prove that it's really
    there„ÄÇ I can run exclamation point L„ÄÇ So that's the Unix Ls command„ÄÇ So I'm listing
    the files in here„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And here's these these files that I've created„ÄÇ You are also given an API key
    with this course„ÄÇ And I send this„ÄÇReally just to the students who are taking the
    course„ÄÇ If you're a member of the general Internet„ÄÇ there areÔºå if you look on
    my linked Patreon site„ÄÇ there are some levels that will give you access to this
    if you're interested in that„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: but this API key„ÄÇ The one that I have in there is actually not a real one„ÄÇ It
    was a real one at some point„ÄÇ but I essentially swap them out so that I don't
    have everybody submitting on my one demo key„ÄÇ So by the time the course starts
    by the time you're watching this video„ÄÇ This will no longer be a valid key„ÄÇ I'm
    going to run this program„ÄÇ assignmentment one is very easy„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It's just proving that you can go through the motions and actually get a python
    program running and submit it„ÄÇ I run it hereÔºå Now you might get an error like
    thisÔºå this is important„ÄÇ So it's saying users Jheton file I found it needs to
    know where your notebook file is so that it can send it„ÄÇ This is more for Mac
    Linux„ÄÇ So switch„ÄÇTo this one for coabab„ÄÇ NowÔºå you will need to modify this„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: perhaps„ÄÇ So don't you won't have your name„ÄÇ It'll be whoever your name is„ÄÇ So
    J Heaton underbar class 1„ÄÇ So wherever this is namedÔºå it'll probably be this pretty
    exactly„ÄÇ but make sure you put your name in there„ÄÇ And now we can try to submit
    it again„ÄÇ and it worked„ÄÇSuccessÔºå you have submitted assignment1„ÄÇ This is just
    a demo account„ÄÇ that's actually my wife's name„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You have submitted this assignment four timesÔºå which is fine„ÄÇ So you can submit
    these as many times as you want„ÄÇ if you get warnings down here telling you that
    there's something wrong with it definitely fix those warnings because they will
    that will surely cause you to lose points„ÄÇ NowÔºå sometimes it'll say that your
    value is off from mine by some number if that's like 0„ÄÇ0123„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: something like thatÔºå a small small number„ÄÇIt probably doesn't matterÔºå but again„ÄÇ
    no guarantees on your actual grade from the auto assessor„ÄÇ It's just there to
    help you out„ÄÇ to give you„ÄÇA chance to not lose points on easily corrected issues„ÄÇ
    These are due each week„ÄÇ Make sure that you submit them„ÄÇ If you submit them lateÔºå
    you'll lose points„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's just the way that that works„ÄÇ If you submit them too lateÔºå you will get
    no points at all„ÄÇ So make sure that you„ÄÇStay on top of these„ÄÇ This is a hybrid
    course„ÄÇ so it's very important that you stay up with it on a week to week basis„ÄÇAnd
    not just try to ask„ÄÇTurn everything in on the last last day of course„ÄÇ You can
    also check your submission„ÄÇ
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: This is just some additional code„ÄÇ You put your key in there and you can make
    sure that I've gotten an assignment or not„ÄÇ now you won't see these pop into canvas
    until I actually grade them„ÄÇ and then it becomes part of your your actual course
    grade„ÄÇ Okay„ÄÇ that is how you make use of Google coab„ÄÇ This is a very good option
    for if you don't want to go through all the trouble of installing Python and the
    various utilities on your computer„ÄÇ
