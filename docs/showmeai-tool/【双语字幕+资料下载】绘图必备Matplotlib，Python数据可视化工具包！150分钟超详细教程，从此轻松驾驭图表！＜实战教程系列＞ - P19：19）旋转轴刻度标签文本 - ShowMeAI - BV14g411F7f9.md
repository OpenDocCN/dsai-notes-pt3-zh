Okay， next question rolling right along here。 So this is a very common one。

How do you rotate access text？And this isn't something that we've had to use， really。

 because our access text has looked fine。 but a lot of the time。

You might have very long labels here and they all run into each other and you can't read anything and so you're like。

 well， I need to rotate these so I can see them。

So I'll show you how to rotate your。Accs your axis。Tick labels。

 And we're going go back to our friend the tick parametersms method。 So A X dot plot， X， Y。

 PL T dot show。

All right， let's rotate these X axis labels。So we're going to go back to Ax do tick parameterss。

 And if you look at the documentation， or if you remember。

 you can remember that we can pass in which axis we want to do it to。

 and then we can pass in any parameters that we can apply to these these labels here。

 So I'm going to pass in the parameter rotation equals， let's try 45。

And there you go。 Now they're nice and rotated。 and if these labels were very long。

 they would not run into each other。
