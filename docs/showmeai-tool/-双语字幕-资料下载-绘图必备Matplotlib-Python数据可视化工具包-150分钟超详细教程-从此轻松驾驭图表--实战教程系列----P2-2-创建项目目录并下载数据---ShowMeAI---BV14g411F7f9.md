First things first， I'm going to open up a terminal， and I'm gonna create a I'm gonna create a new。Let me drag this terminal over here。 I'm going create a new directory for us to work in for this project。 So this is how I like to start new projects。 Let's let me do a little Ls here。 Take a look at my home directory。 you'll see that I have this folder project data science。

 I'm gonna go ahead and change in here， If I do Ls。 you'll see。 These are the directories for the other courses and the other videos that we have recorded here that are online。 I'm going to make a new directory。 Let's call this mat plot Lib。😊。We'll call this mappl Lib tutorial。 Let's just call it that。

So I will C change directory into Maplot Lib tutorial if I do an LS。 you'll see that there is nothing in here and that's because we haven't created anything in here。 we just created this directory。So， that's looking good。Now。 we're going to be using some data that we create in this tutorial。

 but we're also going to be using a little bit of data on heart disease。 a little bit of data from kle here。 So I'm going to open up a new chromrome window。 let me drag this Chrome window over here。 And if you go to kggle heart disease。 Let's see。 we have the heart disease data set。 We've got predicting heart disease。 Let's go here， predicting。

Heart disease。 And actually， if we click this heart disease UI link right there。 This is the one that we're going to want。 So Caggle dot com slash Rony TF R O N I TF。 and then heart disease U I。 I'll make sure to post this link so that you have it。 But this is where we're going to be downloading our data from。This is a data on heart disease。

 We can take a look at the description here。 The database contains 76 attributes。 but the published experiments for this data only use 14 of them。 and those are the 14 that we're going to have in this data set。In particular。 the Cleveland database is the only one that's been used by machine learning researchers to this date。

 etc cetera， et cetera。 So this data set originally comes from UCI。 So the UCI machine learning repository。 So if you come here。You'll see that these are some very popular machine learning data sets。 So we're going to be using this heart disease one here， but we're just going to get it from Cagle。

So， let's。Go up here。 click this download button。 if you don't have a Caagle account。 you'll probably need to create  one。 I will click on this zip file that gets downloaded。 It opens up this heart dot CSV。 I'm going to rename this really quickly just to what the zip file was named。 actually， which was heart disease U C I。

And now， just to show you。How to do this in the terminal。 I'm going to come back over here to our directory， our MapllootlibB tutorial。 which if we go to project Data science and Maplotlib tutorial you'll see that this is right here。 and I'm going to move Mv from our downloads heart diseasease UCci。csv。

 and I'm going to move that to just period， which means this directory so I move that do a little Ls to show that we have our heartdisease UCci。csv file in here。O。So now， if I。If I go and I double check that our CSV file really is there。 I'll go ahead and double click this。 We can pull it up in Excel， really quickly。Just to take a look at what it looks like。

Allright， Just a bunch of numbers。 See a bunch of numbers here。 and we have our column headers across the top。 So we have the age of the person。 the sex of the person。 These are ones and zeros and the original or the Caal data set over here gives us the mapping。 So one equals male，0 equals female。 And then we've got these other numeric columns as well。

 And this is what we're going to be plotting for some of the tutorial。![](img/7d77afa5bca5410549c41cf4ebbe259f_7.png)

So coming back over here， let's go ahead and close this and go ahead and close。
