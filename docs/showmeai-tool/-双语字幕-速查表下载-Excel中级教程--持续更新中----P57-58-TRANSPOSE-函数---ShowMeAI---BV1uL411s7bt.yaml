- en: In this short Excel video， I want to show you how to use the transpose function
    in Excel。 Here I am in an Excel spreadsheet that I've started using， and I'm regretting
    a little bit。 how I laid out this information。 I don't know if you've ever had
    that experience where you start typing in data。 You put in your column headings
    you put in your rows。 And then you say to yourself， wait a minute。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: maybe I should have put in this case， the names vertically in column a instead
    of horizontally in row 1。 I know that's happened to me a few times。 In other cases，
    the way I've entered the data is fine。 And it's what I want。 But I might want
    to have it also displayed in the opposite way。 maybe on a separate spreadsheet。
    So we're going look at an Excel function called transpose that will help us do
    that。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I'm going to begin by clicking on this plus sign to add sheet number 2。
    And I'll go to the upper left corner of where I want the new data to appear。 And
    I'll tap the equal sign and type in。Transpose。 you can see that Excel recognizes
    the function that I'm trying to use。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: and it gives me a description。 It converts a vertical range of cells to a horizontal
    range or vice versa。 So now I'll type left parenthesis。 and Excel is now expecting
    an array。 In other words。 a range of information。 So I'm going to click back on
    sheet 1 And then I'll simply click and drag to highlight the range of information
    that I would like to transpose。 I think I got everything。 And now I'll just type
    the right parenthesis here in the formula bar。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: You can see that same formula that I started on sheet 2 is still present with
    me here through the formula bar。 And I put in the right parenthesis。 It usually
    works fine without the right parenthesis。 but I'm trying to get in the habit of
    always putting it in there。 So now I'll tap enter on the keyboard。 and I get a
    little message saying my formula spilled the formula return multiple values。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So we spilled them into the neighboring blank cells。 Got it。 That sounds fine
    to me。 So let's see how this worked。Just like I expected。 it took the data on
    sheet1 that has people's names across the top and phone number。 donation amount
    and state across the left side of the spreadsheet。 And on sheet 2。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it flipped all of that。 That's exactly what I wanted。 But to help us see this
    better。 I'm going to click and drag from A to D here at the top in the column
    letters。 And then I'll just double click between any two of those columns。 How
    about here between C And D right on that line。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Just double click that will automatically resize the columns so that the information
    in the columns fits perfectly。 let's take a look at this data。 So for the most
    part， it looks like it worked well。 Let's test it out with Katherine Macinturf。
    If I go back to sheet 1。 I can see that Katherine Macinurf， Her phone number ends
    in 58。 She donated $58。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: That's a coincidence。 and she's from New Jersey。 Let's test that out。 Catherine
    Macinturf 58。58 New Jersey So it looks like the information was trans。accurately
    and safely， Having said that。 it did change the way some of the data is displayed。
    For example， it added a0 here。 And unfortunately， I can't just delete that。 Now，
    the reason why is because even though it says0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: There's something other than0 in that cell。 If I select it， you can see it here
    in the formula bar。 That's where my transpose formula is located。 So if I delete
    that cell and tap enter。 it erases all of the data off of sheet2。 It's still on
    sheet1， but not sheet 2。 So I'm going to hold control and tab Z to undo that。
    So I need to leave that there。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: It looks like my phone numbers got messed up a little bit。 so I can click on
    B。 go to the home tab and in the number group， I can change the number format
    by going here to more number formats。 and I can go to special phone number。 Now，
    those are converted to phone numbers。 I can do the same kind of thing with the
    dollar amounts。 But for the most part。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: this has been a very successful transposition that I've done。 Now it。Important
    to know that if I change the information in sheet1， like the donation amount for
    Morgan。 let's say he donates a little more。 Morgan's information will also change
    on the linked sheet。 when it transpos the links stay intact。 If that's not what
    you want。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: you should probably transpose using copy and paste special。 And if you want
    to see how to do that。 watch my tutorial on transposing data in Excel。 The other
    thing you could do is now that you've transpoposed the data。 you can click and
    drag to highlight all of the data。 and then hold control and tap C to copy the
    data。 and then you could go to another sheet。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: let's say or somewhere in the same sheet， click in the upper left corner of
    where you would like that data to be displayed。 and then go to the home tab home
    ribbon clipboard group。 And I'm going to click here on the bottom part of the
    paste button。 And I'll just go here to paste values。 Now， let's try it。 if I delete
    that0。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the data is still there。 Why because when I did paste。Special and pasted the
    data as values。 It converted the data from information that was created by the
    transpose function and formula that I wrote。 It changed it from that and converted
    it to simply values。 So now at this point， if I wanted to。 I could delete sheets
    1 and 2 and sheet 3 is still intact。 This is now independent data。
