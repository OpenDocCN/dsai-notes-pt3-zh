- en: In this tutorial， I'm going to focus on the autofill handle in Excel。 sometimes
    also just called the fill handle。 And I touched on this in my intermediate Excel
    skills tutorial。 But I wanted to in this tutorial to focus exclusively on the
    autofill handle。 And what is the autofill handle， Basically， it is just this innocent
    looking green square in the lower right corner of a cell that you've clicked on。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So if I click on this cell， there it is looking innocent and not particularly
    powerful or useful。 there it is again， there it is again， So that little green
    square。 What is its purpose。 General。 it helps you to copy the contents of a cell。
    For example。 if I click here in I1 and I type a name and tap enter on the keyboard。
    That name is now in cell I1。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And I can then click on I1 and go to the autofill handle and click and hold
    the click and then drag down and what is。It do。 It copies the contents of I1 copies
    it down as far as I clicked and dragged。 Now it works that way， particularly with
    text。 There are some exceptions。 but if you want text to be copied click on the
    cell that has the text。 go to the autofill handle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: click and drag and it copies it down。 Now with numbers， sometimes it's a little
    different。 So let's try some numbers。 here in J1， I'm going type in number1。 and
    then click away and then back to the one， and then I'll click on the autofill
    handle and drag down。 and you can see it's still copied the number1 copied it
    down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So it worked the same way with numbers。 However， the autofill handle can also
    be used to extend a pattern so I can establish a pattern 1。2，3。 and then I can
    click and drag to show Excel that pattern to identify it。 by highlighting this1。2，3，
    Excel is smart。 and it's figuring out， okay， that's what he wants。To continue
    that pattern。 So now as I use the autofi handle， look what it did， it extended
    the pattern。 Now。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: the pattern can be kind of complicated。 if you want it to be。 So I could put
    in。 let's say some odd numbers only click and drag to highlight the odd numbers。
    use the autofill handle。 And look， it continued the pattern only odd numbers。
    So you can play with that。 and see what kind of patterns the autofi handle in
    Excel can recognize。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， the autofill handle， or again， it can be called just the fill handle also
    works particularly well with anything related to time。 And so here we have a time
    here at the left， This is a weekly schedule。 And we have one day Sunday。 but I'd
    like to add all of the days here。 Well， do days relate to time。 Yes， they do。
    And so watch what happens if I click on Sunday and use the autofi handle。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: I can click and drag And as I do， you can see a preview appear down here。 So
    I can see that it is extending。The pattern。 Now， there wasn't a pattern。 but because
    Sunday is related to time。 The Autofill handle just figures it out and realizes
    that I'd like to have Monday come after Sunday。 Now， what if that's not the case。
    typicallyy， yes， you want Monday to follow Sunday。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: But what if I just want the word Sunday repeated over and over。 If you want
    to force the autofill handle in Excel to copy like it did with Jason Smith and
    not to extend a pattern。 all you have to do is click on the cell， use the autofill
    handle， But before you click。 hold the control key on the keyboard。 and then drag
    And that way。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: it forces it to copy and not to extend the pattern or follow a time sequence。
    I'm going undo that because I really do want the days of the week。 And I'll just
    clear out Jason Smith here at least the extra ones。 Now， let's look at times。
    here we have 6 AM， I'll just go to the Ofill handle， click and drag and pull that
    down until。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: say 10 PM because the time of day is related to time。 The autofill handle just
    knows what to do。 It just added an hour to each cell。 And when it got to PM。 it
    didn't hesitate it just switched to PM。 Now， you might be thinking。 what if you
    want it to be not 6 AM to 7 AM。 but maybe 6 AM to 6，30 AM。 Well， just type in
    6，30 AM。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: And then show， Excel the pattern。 So I click and drag to highlight 6 and 6，30。
    That's the pattern。 I go to the autofill handle。 click and drag and pull down。
    And now the pattern goes every 30 minutes， not every 60 minutes。 So this autofill
    handle is really pretty smart。 Other things related to time that work well with
    this include also the months。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So January。 And you can spell it out， or you can abbreviate it either way。 But
    it's understood by the autofill handle to be months， which are related to time。
    And so it just。Automatically extends the pattern。 But again， if you don't want
    it to do that。 hold control and click and drag the autofill handle， and it will
    just copy and not extend a pattern。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Now， one other thing to be aware of。 when you're working with a small manageable
    spreadsheet like this one that really only has 20 or 30 rows in it。 It's totally
    reasonable to just click and hold the autofill handle and drag down， right。 that's
    not a burden， it's not difficult， but imagine a spreadsheet with 500 rows。1000
    records or whatever it is。 how tedious would that be to click and drag the autofill
    handle down。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Well， the good news is， instead of clicking and dragging it down。 you can highlight
    the cell。 or in this case， the pattern， the range that you want to copy or extend。
    and then just go to the autofill handle and double click。 Now， you can see what
    it did。 it extended the pattern all the way down as far as my data goes。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: So because my data only reaches row 19。That's as far as the autofill double
    click went。 It didn't go any further because there's no data below that。 And so
    that's why if I go to a new sheet and I just type in January。 and then I click
    on the cell and double click on the autofill handle。 look， nothing happens。 Why。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: because January is already as far down as my data goes， there's no data below
    it。 if I add some data like that。 then now I can double click and it extends the
    pattern or the time sequence as far down as my data exists。 So back on sheet 1，
    I can just double click here on the April autofill handle and it fills it in the
    rest of the way down。 So I hope that you'll look for opportunities to use the
    autofill handle。 when you're using it。
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: use the click and drag method when you're dealing with a short list like this
    one here。 If if the list is much longer， you might want to just double click on
    the autofill handle and have it automatically populate down。On the page。 And then
    remember， if you don't want to extend the pattern or the time sequence。 just hold
    the control key when you click and drag， and it will just simply copy and repeat。
