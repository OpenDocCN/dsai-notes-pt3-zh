- en: 哦。In this tutorial， we're going to look at cross joins in SQA。 we use cross
    joins to combine or join every record from the first table with every record and
    the second table。 Here's an example。 Let's select everything。😊，From the customer's
    table。Now here we do a cross join。With the products table。 So every record in
    the customer's table will be combined with every record in the products table。

- en: And that is why we don't have a condition here。 Okay， so this is what we call
    a cross join。 Now for clarity， let's pick a couple of columns。 like see that first
    name。We rename it as customer and then。Product the name， which wename to product。Also。
    let's sort the result by customer。t first name。Now let's execute the query。😊。
  id: totrans-3

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Here is the result of a cross joinin。 So first we have Amber as the customer。
    and here are all the combinations of amber with different products。 Next。 we have
    barbara or whatever it is。 And again， we have the combination of this customer
    with all the products。 Now in this particular example， it doesn't really make
    sense to use a cross joinin。

- en: A real example for using cross joins is where you have a table of sizes like
    small， medium， large。 and a table of colors like red， blue green， whatever。 And
    then you want to combine all the sizes with all the colors。 that is when you use
    a crosstroin。😊。Now， what we have here is called the explicit syntax for a cross
    join。
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: We also have the implicit syntax， which looks like this instead of typing out
    the cross join。We type out multiple tables in the F clause， so customers and orders。Both
    these queries produce the same result， but I personally prefer to use the explicit
    syntax because it's more clear。

- en: And here is a simple exercise for you。 Do a cross join between shippers and
    products。 first do it using the implicit syntax and then using the explicit syntax。
    It's pretty straightforward。 I just want you to get your hands dirty in the code
    and get used to this syntax。😊。

  id: totrans-11

  type: TYPE_IMG
- en: Al right， first， I'm going to use the implicit syntax， and then I will show
    you the explicit syntax。 So let's start by selecting everything from two tables，
    shippers。😊，And products。Now for clarity。 let's pick two columns， Shiper do name，
    which we were named to Shiper。And product of name。 which were renamed to product。And
    finally， let's order everything by shipper that name。
  id: totrans-12
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
- en: Let's execute the query。This is what we get。 So the combination of all shippers
    and all products。 beautiful。 Now let's use the explicit syntax。 So we select everything
    from the base table in this case。 shippers and then do a cross join with products。😊，That
    produces exactly the same result。
