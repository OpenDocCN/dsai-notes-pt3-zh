    University In this part„ÄÇ we're going to look at how to use a deep Q neural network„ÄÇ
    So a deep reinforcement neural network that allows the computer to learn to play
    a game„ÄÇ We're going to start with a relatively simple exampleÔºå we're going to
    see Polcart using TF agents„ÄÇ

    by a hinge to the cart and I print out some basic data on it so you can see that
    the observation there's basically four values being observed which is basically
    the velocity of the cart the angle of the pole and the angular velocity of the

    it played out and summing that up„ÄÇ So this is a function really this entire carpool
    example comes from the TF agents examples and then I expand it to play an Atari
    game in the next part but this is basically just looking at what was their average
    return over a number of episodes in this case 10 I find this to be a good way
    to measure this because the world that the agent is operating is stochastic so
    there is some randomness going on there so each of these episode runs are not
    going to be the same and the average that it gets with those randomness gives
    you an idea of how good it's performing and you can see with this comment here
    that was in the T agents example TF agents does have a number of builtin metrics
    that you can use and I definitely encourage you to take a look at those we compute
    the average return for the random policy just showing that it works replay„ÄÇ

- en: BufffferÔºå this is very important is fundamentally you're training a neural network
    through all of this and this lets you store the data that you're training the
    neural network on because the way the neural network is actually working is you
    have a state and that state in old school cu learning every possibility of the
    state can result in some action and we simply train the neural network for each
    of these actions that you might have predict what the Q value is what the possible
    reward is so you feed the neural network in the state and it returns to you all
    the rewards of the action Now this is using a table so the problem with the table
    is you have to have a row for every single possible state and you just look it
    up and you find it Now with a neural network the state is going into the input
    neurons and then the neural network through neural network magic predicts for
    you which action you should take so it gives you the Q values of all your possible„ÄÇ

    And that's what you're teaching the neural network to do because this works better
    than having a table„ÄÇ You can't have a table for every possible combination„ÄÇ The
    neural network learns to generalize this theoretical gigantic high dimensionmenal
    table and basically predict for you those Q values„ÄÇ data collection„ÄÇ this is where
    you're generating those 1000 steps so that you get a random set of data So what

    data and this is right from the example and Tf agents What we're doing is we're
    getting we're calculating the time step So how far we want to project we're taking
    the action over that time step and then we are we are getting all the data from
    that step in the trajectory that it use to get to the next step of the action
    and adding that into the training batch„ÄÇ

- en: That is how we're slowly building one by one these rows that the neural network
    is actually learning to train on then we go through the number of requested steps
    This is actually a bug I found in the TF agents code I left it exactly like this
    but they do have a hyperparameter up higher where they let you specify the number
    of steps and down here they ignore it and just do100 I fix that actually in the
    Atari example in the next one because that becomes important and then we convert
    this into a data set and we're basically ready to go Now we're training the agent
    I kick this off earlier and fortunate it finished so that is good we are basically
    going through a loop here listen set up the number of iterations that we want
    to step it through so that's the 20000 from up higher it's one by one building
    the continuing to build the data set that we have so that we continue to train
    the neural network on it based on the rewards that we're actually seeing if we
    reach the log interval that we wanted then we go ahead„ÄÇ
