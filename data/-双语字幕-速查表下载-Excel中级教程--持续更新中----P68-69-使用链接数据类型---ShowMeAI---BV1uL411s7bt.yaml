- en: In this video I'm going show you how to work with the new linked data types
    that you can find in Excel。 Now this is for Microsoft 365 versions of Excel， but
    this also works with Excel for the web So even if you don't have Microsoft 365
    you can still give this a try So let's take a look at my workbook you can see
    that I have three different worksheets the first one has a list of movies just
    some random movies and let's say I'd like to add some information about those
    movies。

  zh: 在这个视频中，我将向你展示如何使用Excel中的新链接数据类型。这是针对Microsoft 365版本的Excel，但也适用于Excel网页版。所以即使你没有Microsoft
    365，仍然可以尝试一下。让我们看看我的工作簿，你可以看到我有三个不同的工作表，第一个包含一些随机电影的列表，假设我想添加关于这些电影的一些信息。
- en: maybe the year that they came out maybe how much money each movie made while
    it was in theaters。 maybe who directed each movie and I can certainly look this
    information up I can open up Wikipedia or IMDb or some other website and gather
    that information and put it into this spreadsheet and in the past that's exactly
    what I would have done but now with a recent Microsoft 365 update look what you
    can do in Excel。
  id: totrans-3

  zh: 也许是它们上映的年份，或者每部电影在影院期间赚了多少钱，也许是每部电影的导演。我当然可以查找这些信息，打开维基百科或IMDb或其他网站，收集这些信息并放入这个电子表格，过去我确实是这样做的，但现在随着最近的Microsoft
    365更新，看看你在Excel中可以做什么。
- en: I can highlight the range of data and as long as。I'm signedign into my account
    look what I get on the data tab in the data types group there's a button here
    for stocks one for currencies and if I click on this button I get even more or
    this button pops open with the full list of linked data types that I have access
    to in Excel So basically what this means is that Excel can automatically identify
    some terms or some of the items that fall into these categories so things related
    to chemistry things related to plants or animals space so stars planets。

  zh: 我可以高亮选择数据范围，只要我登录了我的账户，看看我在数据选项卡的数据类型组中能得到什么，这里有一个股票按钮，一个货币按钮，如果我点击这个按钮，会弹出一个包含我在Excel中可以访问的所有链接数据类型的完整列表。所以基本上，这意味着Excel可以自动识别一些术语或属于这些类别的项目，比如与化学、植物或动物、太空相关的内容，比如星星和行星。
- en: things like that information related to cities locations and even yoga So let's
    try it out with our list of movies I'm going to click on movies and at this point
    it seems like Excel has frozen it doesn't look like much is going on but if you
    look at the bottom of the screen there is a message saying that it is converting
    the data into data that's linked it simply means that there is information being
    linked from the internet into Microsoft。
  id: totrans-5
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 诸如此类的信息涉及城市、位置，甚至瑜伽。那么让我们用我们的电影列表来尝试一下。我将点击电影，此时Excel似乎冻结了，看起来没有什么进展，但如果你查看屏幕底部，会有一条消息说它正在将数据转换为链接数据，这意味着正在从互联网链接信息到Microsoft。
- en: Excel and much of that information comes from Wolfram。 which is a website that
    you can go to and this information is updated on a regular basis So when new movies
    come out。 that information will be added statistics from the cities and information
    about population and things like that will be updated on a regular basis as well
    So let's take a look at the results us linked data types in this spreadsheet so
    you'll notice in my list any movie that has this camera icon next is recognized
    by Microsoft Excel's one to the future that Excel is not what to do with there's
    multiple movies with that name the future so this is the one I'm talking about
    so I click on it click select and now that movie has the movie icon next it what
    about Gremlins that's the one I'm talking about with Js So this is mostly happening
    with movies that have sequels Excel is not which of the movies I'm really talking
    about in。

  zh: Excel中的许多信息来自Wolfram，这是一个你可以访问的网站，这些信息会定期更新。所以当新电影上映时，这些信息会被添加，城市的统计数据和人口等信息也会定期更新。那么让我们看看这个电子表格中的链接数据类型的结果，你会注意到在我的列表中，任何带有相机图标的电影都被Microsoft
    Excel识别为“未来”的多部电影中，Excel不知道该如何处理，所以我在说的就是这个，所以我点击它，选择，现在那部电影旁边有了电影图标。至于《小精灵》，我在说的就是这个。所以这主要发生在有续集的电影上，Excel不确定我到底在说哪部电影。
- en: Of this particular movie， the Sparks Brothers。 This recently came out and it's
    kind of a smaller movie。 So it's not yet part of the linked data。 And so that
    one's just not going to work for us。 That's okay。 I'll move on to the birds and
    in some cases you may need to change the titles。 So I just changed it to birds
    and then it did recognize it。

  zh: 关于这部特别的电影，斯帕克斯兄弟。这部电影最近上映，是一部较小的电影，所以它还没有成为关联数据的一部分。因此，这一部分对我们来说不适用。没关系，我会继续处理鸟类，有时候你可能需要更改标题。所以我只需将其更改为鸟类，然后它被识别了。
- en: So now all of the movies except for one I recognized by Excel。 Now that that's
    the case。 check out what I can do。 I can click and drag to highlight the range
    and then go to this little icon that pops up where it says insert data and I can
    click and look at all this information that's linked to the text that I've typed
    into Excel and it's been recognized and linked to this online data。
  id: totrans-8

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 现在除了一个，所有的电影都被Excel识别了。既然如此，看看我能做什么。我可以点击并拖动以高亮范围，然后去那个弹出的插入数据的小图标，我可以点击查看所有与我在Excel中输入的文本相关的信息，它们已被识别并链接到这个在线数据。
- en: So I want to know the genre of each of these movies。 I click genre and it fills
    it in for me except for Sparks brothers unfortunately at this point I probably
    should expand column B so I'll just double click between B and C and it expands
    out let's try this again I'll just highlight the range go back up。
  id: totrans-9

  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 所以我想知道这些电影的类型。我点击类型，它为我填写了，除了斯帕克斯兄弟。不幸的是，在这一点上，我可能应该扩展B列，所以我只需双击B和C之间，它就扩展了。让我们再试一次，我将高亮范围，然后回到上面。
- en: That icon click I would like an image of each of the movies Take a look at that
    and let's try it again I'd like to know the release date and I'd like to know
    the director and I'd like to know the international box office total receipts
    so how much total money did this movie make across the world and so very very
    quickly thanks to the linked data types I've been able to create a spreadsheet
    full of information about those movies and very quickly I can format the column
    headings just the way I want them to be now as you can see there are some parts
    of this spreadsheet that it didn't work for obviously the Spars Brothers but also
    there's not information about the box office totals for some of these movies so
    I can just delete those out and either add in information from another source
    or just keep it blank Okay let's try it again but this time with a different spreadsheet
    this one is a list of states in the United States So I'll click and drag to get
    the range and this time I'm gonna include a1 so I'll go down。
  id: totrans-10
  prefs: []
  type: TYPE_NORMAL
  zh: 我想要每部电影的图标点击一下，看看这个，然后再试一次。我想知道上映日期，想知道导演，想知道国际票房总收入，那么这部电影在全球赚了多少钱？得益于关联数据类型，我能够迅速创建一个包含这些电影信息的电子表格，并且我可以迅速按我想要的方式格式化列标题。现在你可以看到，这个电子表格中有些部分显然没有效果，比如斯帕克斯兄弟的部分，但还有一些电影的票房总数也没有信息，所以我可以直接删除这些，或者从其他来源添加信息，或者就保持空白。好吧，我们再试一次，这次用一个不同的电子表格，这个是美国各州的列表。所以我会点击并拖动以获取范围，这次我要包括A1，所以我会往下拖。
- en: to a21 and let's go back to the data tab there in the data types group we'll
    go here and choose geography。 Once again， Excel kind of freezes for a second and
    that can take longer than you would expect especially if you have a lot of data
    in your spreadsheet so this time all of the states in my spreadsheet a recognized
    I can tell because there's a little map icon next to each state Excel didn't know
    what to do with the word states it's the column heading and so it just puts a
    question mark there that's fine Now I want you to see what if instead of selecting
    the entire range what if you just pick one of the states and then click this button
    it brings up a bunch of linked information but this is only going to add this
    additional information in this case for the state of Alabama so if you want all
    of it to be brought in you need to select the entire range and then go up and
    click this icon I would like to know the leaders of those states the largest cities
    the number of people per household and the housing。

  zh: 到a21，我们回到数据选项卡，在数据类型组中，我们选择地理。再一次，Excel卡顿了一秒钟，这可能比你预期的要长，特别是如果你的电子表格中有很多数据。这次我电子表格中的所有州都被识别了，我能知道，因为每个州旁边都有一个小地图图标。Excel不知道如何处理“州”这个词，因为它是列标题，所以它只是放了一个问号，没关系。现在我想让你看看，如果不选择整个范围，而是只选择一个州，然后点击这个按钮，会出现一堆链接的信息，但这只会为阿拉巴马州添加这些额外信息。如果你想把所有的信息都引入，你需要选择整个范围，然后上去点击这个图标，我想知道那些州的领导人、最大的城市、每户的人口和住房情况。
- en: In that state and once again， all of this data is regularly updated。 so this
    is the information for today， but in six months， some of this information may
    change。 It's all kept fairly up tod one last example I'm going to go to this foods
    spreadsheet and let's try it again Now in this case I don't have a list of just
    10 or 20 foods I actually have looks like 118 different foods listed here So instead
    of clicking and dragging I'm just going to go here to the upper left area in the
    name box and I'll just click and type a2 because I don't really need the headings
    selected through and you can indicate through with a colon a118 I tap enter and
    it selects just the range that I want selected。

  zh: 在这种情况下，再次强调，这些数据是定期更新的。因此这是今天的信息，但在六个月后，一些信息可能会改变。所有数据都保持相当更新。最后一个例子，我要去这个食品电子表格，再试一次。现在在这种情况下，我没有仅仅10或20种食物的列表，我实际上有118种不同的食物列在这里。所以我不想点击和拖动，我会去左上角的名称框，点击输入a2，因为我并不需要选择标题，通过冒号指明a118，我按回车，它只选择了我想要的范围。
- en: I'll go here to the data tab data types group and I'll click to identify this
    range as foods there I get a little bit of a delay but when Excel is done thinking
    about this information I will again have linked to data that I'll be able to pull
    in。To this spreadsheet directly from the Internet。 It looks like it's finished。
  id: totrans-13
  prefs: []

  zh: 我会去数据选项卡的数据类型组，点击将这个范围标识为食物。那里我会有一点延迟，但当Excel完成处理这些信息时，我将再次链接到可以直接从互联网导入的这些数据。这看起来已经完成了。
- en: how many of these foods were recognized。 It looks like almost all of them， which
    is amazing。 It looks like potato chips that was not recognized。 So if I click
    there I might have to pick a specific kind of potato chip。 I'll just go with this
    one here， click select and now it's recognized。

  zh: 这些食物中有多少被识别了？看起来几乎所有的都被识别了，这真令人惊讶。看起来土豆片没有被识别。如果我点击那里，我可能需要选择一种特定的土豆片。我就选这个，点击选择，现在它被识别了。
- en: Now if you looked closely some of these foods that I had in the spreadsheet。
    they were named a little differently than what Excel was expecting。 but Excel
    was able to identify them， and it changed the wording to match the linked data。
    I'll go here to the name box I'll type in a2 through a118 tap enter it selects
    the data。

  zh: 现在如果你仔细观察我在电子表格中有的一些食物，它们的命名与Excel的预期略有不同。但Excel能够识别它们，并将其文字更改为与链接数据相匹配。我会在名称框中输入a2到a118，然后按回车，它将选择这些数据。
- en: and then I can use this button here to click I would like to know the total
    calories of each of these foods I also want to know the cholesterol the total
    protein。 I'd like to have an image of each that would be good。 and I'd like to
    know how much vitamin C each of these foods has。 So this information looks like
    it came in beautiful。😊。

  zh: 然后我可以点击这个按钮，我想知道这些食物的总卡路里，我还想知道胆固醇和总蛋白质。我希望每种食物都有一张图片，这样很好。我还想知道这些食物中每种的维生素C含量。所以这些信息看起来很美好。😊
- en: With the exception of image it looks like Excel is having some trouble getting
    images for most of the foods but I am very excited about this feature in Microsoft
    365 versions of Excel and also Excel for the web this will help me tremendously
    to be able to add in information quickly from the internet and be able to use
    it right away in my spreadsheets Now because this is all linked data to the internet
    what if the information changes online and I open my spreadsheet would it have
    the new information well not necessarily if you want to make sure you have the
    most recent up-todate information What you would want to do is select the data
    and then go to the data tab on the data ribbon here in the queries and connections
    group you can go to refresh all and if you click on the bottom part of that button
    you have some options refresh what's selected or refresh all either way so I'll
    just click refresh and this will take some time now to refresh the data but it'll
    be the most recent information that's available online and itll be。

  zh: 除了图像之外，看起来Excel在获取大多数食物的图像时遇到了一些问题，但我对Microsoft 365版本的Excel以及Excel网页版中的这个功能非常兴奋，这将极大地帮助我能够快速从互联网添加信息，并能够立即在我的电子表格中使用。现在，因为这些都是链接到互联网的数据，如果信息在网上发生变化而我打开电子表格，会不会有新信息呢？其实不一定。如果你想确保拥有最新的信息，你需要选择数据，然后去数据功能区的“数据”选项卡，在查询和连接组中，你可以点击“全部刷新”，如果你点击该按钮的下半部分，你会有一些选项，包括刷新所选数据或刷新全部数据，无论哪种方式。我只需点击刷新，这将需要一些时间来刷新数据，但这将是在线可用的最新信息。
